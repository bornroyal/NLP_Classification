InteriorDesign,Question on ceiling works,"How important is it to have a finished ceiling?

So I hired a design shop to work on my forever home. They are brothers - 1 architect and 1 interior designer.

My home has a bare ceiling. It only has a cement finish and a few led bulbs screwed in. the designers are pushing hard to have the ceiling worked on and add more/better lighting.

While I agree that I hired designers to make my house look good. The ceiling estimate is ~1/4 of my budget. Which shocked me... I was telling them to deprioritized this and prioritize the more important ones (for me) such as having a perimeter fence, cemented carport and backyard (which are just mud/earth at this time) and having a bed, dining table and chairs.

They are telling me the estimate they provided is the maximum estimate for ceiling work and actuals will be much lower. 

I don't really have much knowledge on this, they have been good to me so far and I trust them not to take me for a ride. So I want to ask if there might be something they know by experience that they are unable to explain to me on the need to have a finished ceiling that this sub might enlighten me with."

We don't have months, both due to the kitchen repairs and the fact that I'm pregnant and due this spring.....

So, does anyone know of any cabinet supply companies or similar, where we can find good quality cabinets without spending an absolute fortune?"

InteriorDesign,Agonizing over choosing color in OLD house reno,"For the past six years mom has been renovating a house built in early 1800s in Tenn. Three contractors later (first two fleeced her), she’s ready for paint and flooring, hallelujah! 

However OMG she is agonizing over the paint. For as long as I can remember she’s wanted F&amp;B Green Blue in her house, but now that the walls are primed and samples are up, she’s worried it’s going to be too dark. It does read much darker than the photos she’s pined over for years. She put up a lighter shade (Teresa’s Green) which looks more like the look she wants but the contractor has her agonizing over BOTH colors being too dark. She’s too scared to lose another contractor that she’s giving him too much space in her brain, plus she’s loving the white primed walls and is now contemplating Alabaster white everywhere. I think over time white will feel clinical and antiseptic, or worse, show all the dirt. 

She’s got 10+ ft ceilings and floor to ceiling windows and I think the house can handle the color. However for comparison the color I love in my house (several zones south and less altitude), SW Sea Salt, looks vibrant in my house and dull in hers. To boot we’re having to choose colors in the drab light of winter and they contractor is pressuring her to choose this weekend. She feels like she’ll never get around to repainting (caring for her husband with dementia) so this decision feels bigger than it needs to be. 

Should I push her towards the color she’s always wanted or let her chicken out with white? She wants my input since she plans to leave me the house but I just want her to be happy. I’ll post a photo in the comments since I can’t figure out how to add here. 

Thanks to anyone who can put us out of our angst!!"

InteriorDesign,Choosing an interior designer for kitchen - advice?,"We are redoing our kitchen and are strongly considering working with an independent interior designer to do so. There are other options (general contractor, designers associated with kitchen showrooms), but I'm hoping working with someone independent will provide us with an unbiased design based on what we want rather than what includes the most cabinets or is easiest to build. It will also give me drawings that I can shop around with different vendors and contractors, which will ultimately save money. 

Also, I have been talking to different designers and would really appreciate some. There is one designer whose style I really like. She was referred to me by a good contractor, and I was very positive about our phone discussion. EXCEPT, she is not a certified designer. No NKBA, no NCIDQ, no interior design degree. Red flag?"

Would it be worth it to invest in a masters in design? Do employers care that much or do they mostly look at portfolios? If I take some classes and have a solid portfolio, will hiring managers look at me or not so much without an entire degree behind it?

InteriorDesign,Blending styles,"I know this can be done tastefully but I wanted peoples thoughts because I can’t really find much about blending these two styles. They seem to have a lot in common but the differences are quite different. 

I am working on designing and decorating our home so I’ve been researching design styles so I’m happy with the outcome and design intentionally. I love textures, mandalas, Buddhism and culture, wood, baskets and colors so I was really drawn to Boho. There are some things about boho that I’m not into such as super bright colors, tons of macrame, fabric strips hanging from walls and rugs. I can’t do rugs because I have kids and they’re going to make them dirty all the time lol. I prefer a clean wood floor. I’m also kind of a minimalist so boho can be a bit busy for me. 

So then I stumbled upon Japandi and it also really speaks to me. I really love the minimalism and zen atmosphere but also the cozy textures of it. I also much prefer muted earthy tones like sage, moss, mustard, etc to bright pinks, reds. Is there a way to tastefully blend elements of both I like? I thought it would be fun to have a discussion.

The mirror wall would be very difficult to take down, so if we commit we can't go back. Generally, I'm looking for any advice from people who have large mirrors that receive lots of sunlight in their own homes/offices/spaces, and if this causes overheating/any other issues that I should weigh the pros and cons of before deciding.

She will be online and actively answering questions for about an hour.

Please see below for a statement from her:

----

Have questions about the NCIDQ Exam?  Wondering if you qualify?  Curious about attending a CIDA accredited program vs. non-CIDA accredited program?  Are you aware of the various interior design regulations in place across North America?  Do you know the definition of interior design?  Learn from CIDQ staff member, Kimberly, as she answers these questions and more during an upcoming AMA.

----

If you'll be busy at that time but still want to ask a question, or questions, go ahead and make a comment in this thread and I will copy the questions over to the AMA thread when it's posted. I'll also be working with her to get the thread posted up in the morning so questions have time to accumulate on the day of the AMA.

InteriorDesign,Comparing 2 potential kitchen layouts - floor plan opinions wanted!,"working with a client who wants an Arabian nights themed apartment. (its actually a basement space but needs to function as an independent apartment)  not a full kitchen but an elaborate kitchenette

these layouts both use two 10ft precut slabs of countertop

she mentioned having family over for holidays and wanting seating for 6, they like to sit at the table and play board games.

i'm working on the kitchen now and would love to get your opinions/comparisons/feedback on these two options.      more specifically on the functionality of floor plans rather than decor (which is not added/complete)

for people who dont generally read blueprints or construction documents (my client has a really hard time with them) it would be great to know if any thing i provided really helped to make sense of the space.

InteriorDesign,Does Anyone Know This Fabric? (Client sent this photo),
InteriorDesign,Looking to start a career in interior design,"Hi! I am looking into changing my career to interior design and would love to know how to get there. I have a Bachelors in Business Marketing and have been a Marketing Coordinator at an architecture firm for over two years now. I’ve heard many people say you need to get a degree in interior design, however I can’t afford to go back to school.

I have also been looking at the different CIDQ paths and saw that there is an ‘alternative review program.’ Has anyone taken this unconventional path?

I was looking into the Interior Design Institute for some education. Though it is not a CIDA accredited program, could my marketing degree and this diploma course make me eligible to take the NCIDQ after gaining the minimum amount of work experience hours?"
InteriorDesign,Large Gas Fireplace Insert; Is my only option removal?,"[Album for reference](https://imgur.com/a/2nKJVXS)

Last two photos are the large sofa in a different orientation trying to work with what we got.

Hello! I am trying to work around a very large gas fireplace insert. Previous owner of the home installed it, and it wasn't a deal breaker for me when we bought the house. However over the course of a few months I have grown to despise it. I don't want the TV over the fireplace because it's far too high, and because there is a large amount of heat being generated when the fireplace is in use which might damage the TV.

Ideally, this space is used to entertain and consume media, so Conversation and TV are at the forefront of what we want to do in this space. With a fireplace this large, it feels like its taking over.

The sofas we have are only temporary, and will be replaced soon. While doing the furniture upgrades and adding shelving etc this spring I want to know if there is a way to live with this beast of an insert, as the girlfriend isn't sold on removal as the units surrounding us still have their original fireplaces from 2009. (We are a center unit).

Any and all help is appreciated. I am open to a lot of ideas."
InteriorDesign,Hello everyone! Love this sub + Q about color on color furniture/floor,"So, I have never given thought to interior design nor even decor really up until about a week ago when a great place came up for rent in an area that's highly desirable and lacking in general availability.  After a long hunt, it all worked out.  We've all been there, or most of us, I'm sure.

Anyway, I have found something truly amazing in looking into furnishing a house... art appreciation!  Jean Dunand's work is the first stuff to ""speak"" to me and I now know what it means for someone to be caught by an artwork and have to have it.  However, his works are up there in the echelons of intangible budgets for me currently.  The styling, execution, and materials used, however, was a great starting place and I have since found a pocket in which to look for things in my price range.

To the question:  The floors of concern to me are rouge, like a red clay cement (we're in the desert, here) but still definitely a shade of red and not oak-y or reddish brown.  I can post a picture if need be.  What color furniture would go well with this all in concert?  I have been thinking dark green, very little amounts of gold accents, and medium-shaded grey for the chair/couch stuff, and then... I'm stumped!  Would black throw us off?  Would white be jarring?  Would a dark wood-flavored mix blend too much into the floor and feel off?  I'm thinking about the colors in relation to the floor and also ensemble in relation to each other in regards to coffee tables, end tables, chairs, couches, TV stands/book cases, and what not.

Maybe I am overthinking it all, but regardless, I really love this scene and I would appreciate any advice because as I said, I know nooothing Lebowski.

EDIT: TO ADD PHOTOS.

The floor is a little more rouge in person.  I put in that cabinet thing today, it can go anywhere really, but this gives you an idea of what I'm working with.

InteriorDesign,A bit lost... where do I even start?,"I recently moved into a new house, and have basically no furniture at all. Mattress on the floor, no couch, no chairs, no rugs, etc. I’ve spent weeks looking through various furniture and photos of example rooms, and I don’t like any of it... none of it feels like “me”, and I can’t picture how a particular piece of furniture would actually look, or how it would fit in with the rest of the house as I get more furniture. Even something like buying a plain colored rug... I have no idea what it would actually look like once everything else was in. I have hundreds of examples of stuff I don’t like and why, but I have no idea what I *do like*.

I think the right answer is to hire an interior designer, but here’s the problem: I probably sound like the most annoying kind of client ever, right? I have no idea how to answer the questions about what style I’m looking for/etc. Not sure how I want the rooms layed out, not sure what colors I like for furniture, etc. Is there anything I should look for in an interior designer who may be able to help someone like me? Or things I should learn and research ahead of time? Thanks!"
InteriorDesign,Grout sizing for subway lay,"We are redoing our bathroom in white subway tile with black grout.  The tile will go up to the ceiling in the shower and 44"" up the wall around the rest of the room with white walls above it. The contractor asked what the spacing should be between tiles and that 1/8"" is typical.  I said 1/16 because I was worried that having very thick dark lines between 3x6 tiles all around the room would look odd.  But after viewing the first photo just posted of walk in showers, I'm wondering if I'm wrong.  Those look like 1/8"" and it's not overwhelming at all.  Does anyone have any experience with white tile/black grout that can provide some insight on how it looks?"

InteriorDesign,Help! Advice for a ID student who's had a ROUGH start.,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM
...
If you think some backstory would make a difference, I appreciate any time taken to understand where I'm coming from further. It's been a rough journey and I'm really looking for any great advice to a route of less time wasted!

A few years ago, I moved so I could go to what you could call a career college for woodworking. I wanted to get into furniture design. It was meant to be a 9 month intensive program of full time work as one of a few apprentices. Long story short, the teacher was a grouchy old man who was ready to retire and sell the building. Many times he'd leave to run some errands and not come back for several hours. He was old fashioned and clearly sexist, this was agreed on by the other apprentices and the other man who contributed to renting the building and light teaching so he could do his work there. Our teacher ended up selling all the equipment and machines months prior to any of us finishing our apprenticeships when he thought he found someone to buy the building. They didn't, and he expected us all to finish and continue paying without the equipment or even him about half the time. In the end, I left 2 months prior to finishing and I'm shocked anyone would think 9 months was long enough to understand the basics for furniture making. At least not by the way taught. He ended up moving out of the state and leaving the building to his buddy because he couldn't wait to retire any longer.

After leaving, I was still clueless how I was supposed to move up in furniture design. At this point I was still under the impression I would ever be able to afford a degree. There was a point where I was supposed to assist a couple who did custom furniture orders, they liked the little work I had done and said they wanted to hire me so I could learn along assisting them with furniture, with some secretary and storefront work. We met several times over a few months, but they were still unsure how much they'd be able to pay me. I gave in, stopped asking and stopped meeting with them. As much as I'd love to do it solely for the experience, they did insist they could pay and there's no way I could have pro bono.

With that being a dead end, I was hired as a Design Consultant for a custom furniture store. This is basically sales and customizing furniture orders for the sake of interior decorating. I'd never done sales and dreaded it, I was unfortunately great at it and have been doing it for two years. It didn't take me long to decide though that I'd rather be in control of the big picture, Interior Design over Furniture Design. After looking into what it'd take to get a license in interior design, I decided I'd bite the bullet and say fine, Im will willing put myself into large amounts of debt for a degree in interior architecture and design. I mean I worked with a group of ladies who were all 50+ and loved arguing with a 20 something year old about splitting sales they felt they deserved because they had helped my clients for 10 minutes on my day off. I would've gotten out sooner if I knew that this would not count as experience in the interior design world. Great.

So for the past year to year and a half, I started taking a class or two at a time just online from the local CC. The goal was to take as many classes that I could use to transfer credits and avoid being put in further debt from schools whose classes are $1,000+ each. I'd spoken to the Academy of Art University in SF because theres is the only option with an accredited and online degree. An admissions Counselor told me any of the ID classes that were 300 and up would be transferrable, so that's what I've been taking while also working full time. Last year I started to seriously consider quitting my job so I could achieve my degree faster, but I just didn't know how I could afford it. I also didn't want to put that kind of stress on my bf (now fiancé), not to mention I felt bad quitting our small team of designers in the middle of the pandemic. I finally left after our managers/owners (family owned) made it unbearable to continue working for them (repeatedly leaving on vacation and paying us late in the middle of a pandemic among other things). They even made fun of us for complaining when they got back. A ballsy move for a place that didn't offer benefits.

After finally leaving so I could go to school full time, I wanted to create a laid out timeline so I'd know what to take, how long, etc. So last week, I spoke to the liaison counselor for ID from the CC I'm taking classes from. She also didn't have the transfer guide for the Academy, but found that none of the classes I'd been taking were transferable to them. NONE. I understand the private schools' counselors work off commission and sales, but I didn't think they'd go as far as lying about what's transferable so that they could waste my time with the hope of making as much as possible off of me. There's no way this would work in the way they thought. I'll be surprised if any advice leads me to still attend a private school.

My counselor at the CC gave me a nice script for confronting the Academy counselors, but unfortunately this wouldn't lead anywhere since I think it'd be a waste of my time to go with them. She also recommended I email my ID teacher who has an extensive background in the industry. I have, but I'm still waiting for a response and am not sure if she'll like to spend much time giving free counsel. I find I'm basically starting over, again. The Academy felt like a route to less time wasted but now I'm feeling at a loss of a plan, and questioning the legitimacy of the advice I've received and work I've been doing. I'm also just feeling quite bad for my fiancé who's stuck by me and followed me in the first place to move so I'd be able to go to the furniture school. He's 9 years older than I am, and not that he has ever put pressure on me about our timeline but it's something I can't help but consider for the sake of a family. He's very supportive about continuing, but of course I still have to feel bad that this may mean we move again for the sake of my school that hasn't done anything for us yet.

I am still determined to get my degree but am at a loss of a plan. I'm trying to decide if an ID accredited college would be beneficial to my timeline and advancing or if this would lead to unnecessary stress and money spent. If we weren't to move, this would mean SAC State, and after talking we don't intend on staying in the area anyway.

TL;DR

Have you noticed a difference in career advancement for those who went to an accredited ID college vs those who haven't? / Would you take that into consideration when hiring graduates?

Anything recommended to consider when looking at ID schools."

So as a compromise we are painting an accent wall in Inchrya Blue with the remaining three walls a lighter colour. 

I’ve read that the main focal point of a bedroom is the bed, therefore this is where an accent wall should go. 

However the bedroom has a pretty elaborate fireplace, and the bed itself is pretty minimal.

So my question is, will an accent wall colour against a fireplace work or should I stick to keeping it by the bed?"

InteriorDesign,Job Ideas while in school,"I was hoping to see if anyone in the community could give me any suggestions. I’m getting ready to relocate to a new city, and I am currently in school to get a bachelor’s in ID. All of my schooling is online, so I have a lot of freedom when it comes to working. Ultimately, I want to pursue commercial/restaurant design, but I’m only in my first semester of school so I still have a lot to learn.

For a little more than a year now, I’ve been working as a Kitchen &amp; Bath designer at a big box retail store, which has been mostly great because I have learned a ton and have designed some projects that I’m really proud of! The issue, however, is that it is a retail job at the end of the day, and working for a big retail company means I have to deal with a lot of retail related issues, which can be very draining. I’ve worked retail for a total of 8 years, and I’m just kinda burnt out with it.

I wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions of jobs I could possibly work that would be related to the design field that aren’t necessarily a retail job. I’ve thought about looking at places like local counter shops to see about working in the showroom, which would still be customer service but not necessarily “retail”. I’ve also thought about reaching out to firms in the city I’ll be moving to and checking maybe to be an office assistant? I don’t know any CAD or modeling software yet, so I think I’m still unqualified for an internship or any junior design work. I’m not sure if design firms hire inexperienced assistants, and COVID just makes it harder to find a job.

Does anyone have any suggestions for jobs related to ID that would be possible for a student?"

4. We have done many functional partitions in the living room. An electric clothes drying pole is placed near the window as a drying area. It is convenient to put it up when not in use. Then there is the sofa area, a simple two-person seat, enough for two people to nest together to chase drama. Next to the TV is a folding dining table. Usually when two people are at home, the table can be harvested into a small square table of 60×60. If friends or other family members come over, then the dining table will be a 120×60 normal 4-6 seats. dining table.

My girlfriend studies interior design and is looking for people to complete a survey based on home renovation; particularly in British Georgian or grade 2 listed buildings. This is to help with her research on a current project with a live client. If you are able to spare 5 minutes to complete the survey this would be a great help! If you have any experience staying in or renovating Georgian or grade 2 listed buildings this would be an added bonus. Thank you!

InteriorDesign,I need help with choosing stair tread finish from someone who knows what they're doing lol,"I'm in the process of prepping my stairs to go from carpet to hardwood. I've already prepped my bottom stairs and will do the upper stair case afterwards. Although I'd be able to get a perfect match if I stain it myself, I'll be using stair-tread.com's pre-finished ""retro treads"" because I don't want to mess with sanding, patching, staining, and sealing.
I'd like to match them to the original flooring (engineered vinyl plank) as best as possible, but the samples they sent me are just slightly more red than my golden floor, but really only noticeable in certain lighting. Will the slight variation in color actually draw more attention to the fact that they're slight off? Or am I over thinking it?


I took several photos in various lighting. The risers will be white to match the trim. https://imgur.com/a/GzaXnbe


Also, my floor is EVP, and these retro-treads are hardwood. Will that be weird?"

Hoping you guys can help me out before we pull the trigger and try to buy all these cabinets. We're redoing our newly bought home and could use some affirmation that we're making the right decisions.


Our kitchen is 20 ft deep x 11 ft wide and a little awkward because of doors, chimney and other elements. We were hoping to put an island somewhere instead of the two sided kitchen, but it just won't work given the width. We thought about a peninsula but figured that would break up the space too much and create too tight of a path into the kitchen from dining. We're doing open shelving towards the dining room, and the cabinet to the right of the fridge will be pantry.


I'm wondering if we should take the cabinets above the microwave/fridge all the way to the ceiling? Maybe have open boxes at the top. Above the sink, I'm not sure if we should do a raised cabinet, open shelving, or leave it bare. We had thought about not doing uppers on the sink side as well, but think we need the storage space.


What do you think? We'd love to get some opinions or ideas."

InteriorDesign,Student Trying to Learn about Spec'ing Furniture,"Hi fellow designers. I'm an ID student and something I struggle with is finding furniture that fits my needs. Sometimes it's easy, and a lot of the time in class we look for things based on an overall design style, and not super specific needs. However, when it comes to things like ""I need this material, this colour, these features"" I struggle to know where to look, and I'm wondering how to get better at this?

I usually start by googling a general description of a product I want, and then looking through the links for anything that could lead me to a suitable product. This works a lot for simple things like flooring, wallpapers, lighting, etc. but it gets messy with furniture.

An example: I've been looking for a good adjustable shelving unit for myself for literally months, on and off, and I'm almost at the point where I'm just going to call a cabinet maker in my city to do a bespoke unit. It's not even complex, I basically want a Billy bookshelf from Ikea but with solid flat panel doors and hinges on the inside. I swear I cannot find that ANYWHERE in Canada. If I can't find something that is such a simple design, I feel like I'm going to struggle a lot when I'm working professionally. 

Do any of you have tips on how to improve my search to better find the things I need, when I need to spec something more specific than just ""blue upholstery, art deco style couch""? This is challenging."

InteriorDesign,New Home Office Advice Appreciated,"Hello everyone, new to this sub but seeing some of the posts here I def think I could use some advice. I move into a new place next week and looking to make a nice home office. I have a 14' by 8'6'' den that I can use for myself. The weird thing about the den though is that there is no door and one of the longer walls is open right into our main hallway.

I am a big techy. So hoping to get a (standing) desk, chair, and monitors for sure. I would love to get a couch, coffee table, and tv as well since I like to switch it up from my desk. I think I have ceiling-mounted lights but might need a floor lamp and some type of small table would be cool for some junk and break up the one-directional look of the room..

&amp;#x200B;

My thought right now is the attached picture. TV would be on the right wall. I was going to paint the top wall with some whiteboard paint. Random pics around the swatch of whiteboard paint and on the left wall. And for the bottom wall that isn't a real wall, I was thinking of building a see-thru bookshelf. The shoe closet is in the top left so we would lose access to that, so was thinking the bookshelf would be nice to keep light coming in from different angles, put some shrubs, use some of the pockets for  shoes, and some for random trinkets.

I love markers and ink, or even watercolour, but digital just seems to much easier to manage than a bunch of other tools. I've been looking at iPads and Wacom tablets, but honestly is it worth it? Will it be useful or is that a waste of my money?

InteriorDesign,Potential new design business - Feedback needed!,"Hey all! 

Hope you’re having a good week so far. 

I’ve had what I think is a cool idea for a business within the interior design space and would love your feedback and constructive criticism. I’m only 24 so be nice! :D 

The idea I have is essentially an online service in the form of the website, which you would visit when you were starting an interior design project. 

You’d enter the website and insert some key words such a ‘grey’ ‘sofa’ ‘cushion’ and once you pressed search, it would return with a catalogue of items that matched that description. It would list each item and have a link to the place where you can buy it from. 
In the future I would ensure you’d be able to buy it through the website so it would be an all in one service. 

The service would work where you’d get 5 free searches but then additional would cost per search, only a small amount or additionally if there were interior designers who would use it, they could pay a monthly fee for unlimited searches. 

I’m not sure if anything like this exists already but I’m keen to hear your feedback or maybe even some improvements you think could be added! 

All the best!
Tom"

I can't decide how noticeable this is. Most coffee tables I've seen are no taller than the seat of the couch height. However with other decorations, like throw pillows, a plant on the coffee table, some other books, and a side table, its not the most noticeable. Just wondering if this is a hard and fast rule that I'm breaking. The futon is very low and I do have another coffee table that is low enough but it is not as good a style as the taller one."

InteriorDesign,Renovating flat - help/ideas with the plan?,"[Proposed plan](https://preview.redd.it/xgdhl1ridgz51.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=211696ea34fab95eebe27c45d9594a6e8db77011)

I'm renovating a small 22sqr metre flat. It's a difficult space with some crazy angled walls. The more accurate plan with measurements is how I'm considered doing it. The other image without any measurements is less accurate but how the flat is currently laid out. I've got tunnel-vision on how I've made my plan and any suggestion for changing things up would help!

Some factors to know:

1. From the current layout plan, the bathroom walls are the only ones that can't get knocked down. The bathroom is the small square in the middle, in front of the main door.
2. On my projected plan, I've spearated the bathroom into three rough sections to fit the sink/toilet/shower but without having put explicit measurements for the toilet and sink.
3. There is only one window in the flat.

While, I quite like my plan, I'm having trouble with the bathroom. It's a pretty narrow path to get to the shower. I've had a few ideas of how to handle it:

1. Put the toilet where I've labeled sink and build the tank into the wall. I don't like the idea of entering the bathroom straight to the toilet, especially given the kitchen is on the other side.
2. Have a wall-mounted tank high up. I haven't finished doing the research to see how much space this will save.
3. Possibly I can build the tank into the wall that I've said can't be knocked over, there might be some lee-way.

I haven't thought of the bedroom in any detail. I was trying to avoid putting the Murphy bed/desk against the left-hand wall as it feels strange and unaesthetic in relation to the main entrance door. Also, having your head against the wall where there's the building's hallway is maybe not ideal. I'm open to all suggestions here, really!

Thanks a lot!

Currently have all DWR pieces but hoping to 'shift' from mid-century modern (read: Noguchi table, Tolomeo shade lamp, Zenith shag rug, white 86"" Bantam sofa and armchair w/ exposed walnut legs) to something 'older' and more luxurious (perhaps more brass, heavier and darker pieces).

Quality is a top priority (I read that West Elm is pricy but materials/build quality is low), and prefer these 'nationwide' brands vs. boutiques.

Does anyone have an idea on the current state of these retailers, specifically with regard to quality?

Leaning towards RH or RH Modern for the aesthetic I described (open to suggestions), but curious if the price-to-quality ratio is good or poor. Thanks!"

so I have hit a bit of a road block in this building i am currently working on, i received as built core and shell and jt was not properly coordinated for any other discipline at all, that lead the MEP guy pass HVAC (mini and multisplit ducts) and water and so (terrible i know)
