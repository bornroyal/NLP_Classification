Current picture of plant: https://imgur.com/gallery/jKuvTUC

In January I stopped by my local grocery store and this velvety plant caught my eye. I was like well while I’m stuck at a home like the old days, I might as well see if I can keep a plant alive. I identified the plant I chose as a Calathea Rufibarba. So I have been mindful of watering with filtered water and light exposure. 
      
However, I feel like it needs to be repotted. I mean it came from a grocery store so I’m sure the soil mix is nothing special. It’s also in a 5 in planter pot, and I can see some root action coming through the drainage holes. 

I’ve read they can be finicky plants and don’t want repotting to be my downfall. So far I have some miracle gro indoor potting mix and perlite. 
I’ve found many different soil mixtures for calathea, thus why I’m confused. 
Should I just try some potting soil, perlite and moss?
Or orchid bark? 


And how exactly should I be watering?
I’ve also been bottom watering, not sure if this is the best idea for this specific plant but .

Extra Info:
Since I’ve had it three new leaves have come out, although they are not in good condition. Light green, thin, brown edges.

I'm very new to this - as you can tell by having a plant fall off the balcony! Thanks!

houseplants,Filling the void,
houseplants,My Bamboo looks horrible and seems to suffer a lot. I tried a lot of different approaches but nothing has worked so far :(,"Hello, my favorite plant is my moso bamboo and I feel awful about its condition. I bought the plants 3 years ago and it has been a struggle ever since. If you could help me save it, it would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance!

Of the ~15 seedlings (seed with fresh sprout up to 10cm plants) only 7 survived after I planted them in a big pot with normal flower soil with a bit of compost and garden soil. It stayed wet for way too long and the bamboo didn't like that. As they all seemed to die I decided to change the soil. After reading multiple guides about growing bamboo I mixed up some soil after instructions from a bamboo farm that also grows bamboo in pots/containers (they had percentages for garden earth, flower soil, sand, compost, + some minor additions). Only the biggest 4 plants survived the replanting. They were 15-20 cm at the time and had 3-4 thin stalks.

Over the next ~2 years, one by one 3 of them died as well, the last one over the last weeks.

When I water the pot, most of the water immediately drains into the soil, and if I pour in a bit more than 100ml, it quickly drains to the flower pot coaster. Despite this, the soil always stays a bit damp and never dries out completely even if I don't water the pot for many months.


It was always close to a window (I even tried growing it under a timed growing lamp) so I think light isn't the issue. I had it in my room or a hallway and the temperature also didn't seem to matter. Bamboo fertilizer also showed no effects.

My bamboo grows one or two new shoots every ~6 months. They grow really well for a couple of weeks. Then they suddenly stop growing and 2 months later the fresh tips and leaves dry out and half of the fresh leaves and stalks die. Then the plant goes into hibernation and won't have any visible changes until the next shoots grow. I cut back the fully dead stalks to keep track of what died recently.

houseplants,Question involving painting terracotta pots,"My girlfriend painted a terracotta pot using acrylic paint for me and even used a paint sealer (Motip clear varnish), yet when I used it, the paint instantly washed off from just the outside getting wet. The terracotta didn't even absorb the moisture, the paint actually just came off from a water droplet running down the outside of the pot. A while after all of the paint started bubbling up and we could just wipe off the paint with a tissue. Did she do anything wrong in the process? In case that isn't a good sealer for this purpose, do you have any recommendations for other ones that I could get? I am from western Europe.

Otherwise, do people just water from above and remove the saucer to pour out excess water? Wouldn’t removing the saucer spill water everywhere? 

Would the best thing be to have a plant in a very deep saucer, and bottom water, then remove excess water with a turkey baster? For hard to reach places too ...

Just some ideas. Any feedback would be great!! Thank you"

I've had these plants in their original/plastic potters sitting on top of pebbles/rocks in a decorative ceramic pot for a while now. 

Should I be considering transplanting them out of the potters and into the pots themselves? I like keeping them in potters, becuase it's really easy to pull them out and water them in a sink or something which easily allows them to drain. 

If I transplanted them, then I would have to rely on the pebbles/rocks at the bottom to catch the excess water and then drain them by taking the stopper out of the bottom. 

But I'm also worried that I'm restricting growth by leaving them in the relatively small potters. 

Any thoughts or suggestions? I guess I'm just worried that if I transplant, the drainage won't be as good or sufficient and proper drainage has always been my downfall in maintaining houseplants. These are actually some of the first house plants that I've consistently kept alive for at least half a year."

houseplants,"Looking for ideas: small but very sunny porch, plant novice","Hey r/houseplants

I moved recently and my new place has a porch before/beside the front door. There's a small space (65 x 65 cm, ceiling height) that's kind of going to waste. It gets a lot of sun, since it is south facing with little to no obstruction to the sunlight coming in.  We've nicknamed it the sun trap. 
I live in Ireland so it is not sunny all the time, but when it is, this spot gets it all day. 

I'm looking for some input on plants that could be nice to keep there. Anyone entering the house would come past it so I figured some greenery would be nice! Maybe a narrow shelving unit with some cacti? I read they do well with lots of sun.

I'm a novice when it comes to keeping plants. I've a ficus that has come back from the dead a few times (overwatering...) and I have managed to keep some herbs alive in the kitchen window. But anything too advance I might kill.. 

What ideas do you have for me?"

I have changed the location of the Calathea a few times looking for better spots. It's currently in a secluded spot where the sunlight is indirect for the most part of the day. 

Any advice on how to make this Calathea thrive again would be greatly appreciated!

I recently bought a bird of paradise and my Bengal cat quickly found interest and started to nibble. I looked online for suggestions on how to stop this and people suggested mixing a diluted solution of vinegar and water to spray on the leaves.

I’ve been trying to google for plant ideas to replace an ivy, and I keep seeing articles that basically recommend pothos, philodendrons, or wandering Jews (and then warn that they’re all too heavy for a trellis), and then just recommend a lot of varieties of ivy. 

All of this to say, does anyone know of a plant that would work well on a trellis but wouldn’t make my pets very sick if it dropped a leaf? Has anyone tried a pothos, philodendron, or wandering Jew to know if they work well on a trellis?

houseplants,Fungus Gnat SOS/Desperation,"I know there are many posts on here about fungus gnats and how to treat them and I feel a little bad about making another one. But what do you do when nothing seemingly works? A couple of months ago I repotted most of my houseplants with new soil, which was definitely infested with larvae. In the past month alone I have gone through 6 bottles of hydrogen peroxide, 6 packages of yellow sticky traps, 4 gallons of mosquito bit tea, drying them out, etc. I have put gravel/tiny rocks on some, but they still get gnats  I have used neem oil (which did successfully kill a small mealy bugs outbreak!). Nothing seems to work and they only seem to worsen. 

I am very close to choosing the few that are unaffected and that are dear to me (about 10 out of 50) and setting the rest outside with a FREE SIGN. I feel incredibly guilty about getting rid of them, but it has reached panic attack level infestation. They land on me while I am working and in bed, on my computer, etc. I spend most of my weekends scrubbing dirt and hydrogen peroxide spills off my apartment floor. The plants themselves are happy, they ALL have new growth. Calatheas are a little crispy on some leaf tips, but aren't they all. It's almost like I need permission to just let them go. It makes me feel like a failure when I have spent so much time, energy, and money. Trying to tell myself that they helped fill a void in my life when I needed them and was depressed and I am doing better now. But it feels like I am dropping off a pet I have had for a year at the shelter and driving away. I have 2 cats, one who has some medical issues, so I am not a stranger to responsibility. 

Can anyone relate to this desperation???"

I bought a ficus lyrata and a ficus elastica from a seller on Etsy. The little rubber tree looks great, cannot wait to watch it thrive like the burgundy one I already have at home. I'm concerned about the fiddle leaf fig. It definitely looks cold. Both plants soil was pretty cold, the travelled to Alaska, so I'm not surprised. But some of the leaves have brown spots/holes or little white dots.

Both plants are quarantining in my bedroom for a while. Is there something to be concerned with for the lyrata or could it all just be travel stress?

I have a TON of these little bugs crawling around in the soil of a couple plants. The photo has two you can see circled in red, crawling on the green rim of the pot. They appear to be clear/beige, and about the size of a grain of sand.

The photo showing just one shows the outline more clear.

The plant is an elephant ear plant, and it is doing ok - not thriving though. I wipe the leaves clean every other week.

What are these and how do I cleanse my plant of them?

houseplants,"In general, what's worse: shocking a plant with too much repotting, or allowing it to sit in the wrong soil mix for too long?","I would post this to /r/plantclinic but this is more of a general question, and they like when you keep it specific to one plant. I have a couple of plants that I recently adopted. With hardly any plant knowledge, I thought that I was doing the right thing by going to my local nursery, picking up an all purpose potting soil, and giving all of these plant babies some new nutrients to thrive on.

Now that I've been reading more, I think I did the wrong thing. Here's what the soil bag says: ""Why are we so proud of our all purpose potting soil? It's a screened, lightweight soil made in Minnesota, using North American peat, bark, and compost. It also contains aged rice hulls, a renewable resource to maintain porosity. And to top it off, it's approved for organic gardening"".

Doesn't sound terrible, but I have a mix of new plants with varying moisture requirements: spider plants, transcantia zebra, pothos, philodendron, aloe, haworthia zebra, pilea peperomioides, a peace lily, and a baby fig twig. I'm reading that I should have a mix of things like perlite/pumice/charcoal for plants that need more drainage, and things like coco coir/peat moss/orchid bark for plants that like to stay moist.   


So ideally I'd like to repot a couple of these plants, again, especially because some of them like a couple of the spider plants and the transcantia cuttings are in way too big of a pot, but I don't want to upset them any further by repotting too soon.  


Should I go ahead and amend the soil on these pots ASAP, or do you think it's best to wait and let the plants get accustomed to their new homes first? I'm thinking about future plants too, like taking stuff home from a nursury and wanting to tinker with the soil. If the answer is wait, how long?

houseplants,[Rant] a brain fart resulted in fungus,"These past couple of days have been cloudy, and there was a thunderstorm yesterday, which kept my plants' soil moist. There was one plant in particular, though, that was due for some water. So I went to the sink with the full intention of watering this particular plant. But when I got to the windowsill, I poured the water on one of the plants that already had wet soil. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I didn't even realize what was happening until the container that was holding the water was almost empty. 

I lifted the overwatered plant to see if any water would drip out, but I didn't see anything so, defeated, I laid it down again and got water for the plant that actually needed it. All seemed well.

Except today I noticed that the plant that got overwatered has a white thing that looks like fungus growing on the soil. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I guess it's time to repot?"

I'm in Ohio, and the forced air central heating really dries the place out in the winter, down to about 20% relative humidity. I'm able to keep the smaller plants thriving using humidity trays, but my avocado tree takes a real whack every winter and drops many of its leaves after they brown out.

It’s gotten a bit dry, but I’ve been watering it about every other day now. The yellowing stems are the tallest ones. And they’ve seem to be getting thinner as well. Could this be under watering? Or too much sun? I’ve been giving it some direct afternoon sun, as it hasn’t been getting much, because you know, winter.

Is this a good or bad idea or does it even matter?  I feel like aestetically speaking it would probably look unique but is there any reason not to do this?  I have been debating it and I would love some feedback 😊

houseplants,Texas freeze tried to kill all my houseplants,"During the freeze last week we lost power, and since we live in 110+ year old farmhouse the inside of the house was below freezing for over 24 hours before I was able to remove my plants. I have quite a few plants although most are pothos/ivy types and I have four of those that I’ve inherited from my late Grandma and my wife’s late Grandmother that I would really like to save. Some have a couple of legs that survived, but is there any hope for the legs that seem dark and soft? I was unsure if I should even cut them back or risk letting the soft areas spread to the green parts that somehow survived under the surface. 

I also have a rubber tree plant that took a hard hit and decided to cut the stems until no squishy parts were left because it definitely seemed like parts that weren’t squishy last week were now squishy today. The rootball seems stable in the pot still so I was going to leave my pot of sticks (lol) to see if it produces leaves eventually. Is there anything that might help it come back? 

I’ve never fertilized any of my plants, but most I’ve accumulated in the last year or two so I just haven’t gotten around to researching what to add to them. I was so desperate to try to save some of my sentimental plants that I was melting snow and ice in a pot on the grill just so I could water them because I read that giving them moisture will help them recover. Of coarse none of the store bought plants took as hard of a hit as the sentimental ones, but all of them have at least one or two good legs left on them. At this point I would love to save anymore legs but I’m happy with what survived so none of them are completely gone besides one that was already struggling. They were all so gorgeous before because I had been putting so much love and effort into them, but hopefully with some time and love they’ll be just as beautiful. 

Sorry if this was an odd post; it’s my first reddit post and I’m not entirely sure how this all works. Lol. I’m going to try to include a picture in the comments to see if anyone knows what to do with the vines that are discolored/soft. I was so destroyed to find them all in such bad shape that I was in tears; which I hate to admit, but me and my Grandma had such a connection with plants that I was devastated that I almost killed them within a few months of acquiring them. I hadn’t planned on cutting the legs on the one that she gifted me, but all of the legs on that one have gone soft besides one tiny new leaf that sprouted after she passed away. Thank you for understanding about my weird love for plants if you’ve made it this far through my post, and I appreciate any advice y’all have. Thanks again! 💚"

It has a strangely strong smell, somewhat pleasant from afar but way too strong when close. At first it smelled even rotten to me. Is this how it's supposed to smell? I do have to say that the plant arrived with a few withered flowers, not sure if that's why it smells like this.

To be honest I expected it to smell a little bit better, because I've smelled other jasmine plants and their scent wasn't as strong, and more pleasant, for example the Jasminum grandiflorum one."

I'll be doing the drive in one day and can easily fit them all into my car but I was wondering about the safest way to transport them? I've been thinking to just put them in open boxes in my back seat and strap them in with a seatbelt but if there are other options I'd definitely appreciate hearing some! I have a pretty large monstera and that's gonna be going on the floor of my passenger seat because it'll fit well there. The other plants are all relatively small and should be okay for the amount of time it'll take me to get to my final destination. I know that they'll probably be pretty stressed out once I get to where we're going, but that place is pretty humid and the home has tons of windows for different lighting options, and most of my plants are tropicals so they're be happy! I can't wait to see how they thrive in their new environment, especially since spring is approaching!

Has anyone else done this lately? Any advice is welcome and appreciated!"

The scent of potting mix seems to have taken over my room, maybe when I water my plants im overwatering them or maybe I should water them in 1:1 intervals?

Im not really sure what to do, I don't really mind it.. but I notice the smell and am pretty used to it by now. So I can imagine the smell would be fairly profound to someone who isn't used to it.

Any help on the matter is mucho appreciado."

So I'm just gon' be real with y'all, self-isolation during the pandemic has been kicking my ass when it comes to my mental health. My social life has gone from 'best it's been in years' to 'I haven't seen my friends since March' and I'm in desperate need of something to keep me occupied in these sh*tty times.

The conclusion I've come to is that I want to start filling my apartment with houseplants. I need something to care for, something that'll give me some semblance of a healthy daily routine to keep me from going nuts for the coming months. The thing is that I have no idea where to start. I don't know what plants are good for beginners, what the prices are, where to get my hands on them, etc, etc. So I thought that I'd reach out to my fellow redditors with some (or a whole lot) more knowledge on the matter than me. Here's what my situation looks like:

• I have 3 west-southwest facing windows illuminating everything but the entryway and bathroom. Walls are painted white so there's lots of light available. There's also plenty of unused floor, table and wall space.

• I live in a northern climate (Scandinavia) with cold, dark winters and hot, bright summers. Mild to severe heat waves have been getting much more common here in recent years so any houseplants would have to be able to deal with the summer heat as there's no AC. Heating in winter is not an issue.

• I'm currently out of a job and most likely won't be able to work again until after the pandemic has gotten under control, so price is a factor here. I'm not destitute but also can't go spending a fortune on plants.

• I try going out as little as possible right now so any tips regarding online stores that ship within the EU would be greatly appreciated!

Any advice whatsoever on where and how I should start would mean the world to me. Again, I am a complete newb here so I'm not looking for anything that'll wither and die if I look at it funny, I'm not looking for a challenge. Also, please let me know if this is not the sub to post this in and kindly point me in the right direction if you know where I should turn instead, I don't wanna spam your community with unwanted content.

Cheers!"

I found this guy left out for garbage pick-up this summer and took him home to add to my crew. I'm not sure what it is though.

Also, it seems to have degraded in some ways, as it has lost a fair bit of its needles and is yellowed slightly, though it's growing more, so not sure if it's just a seasonal thing in winter.

It seemed pretty succulent-like to me, so I haven't been watering it very much. Maybe once or twice a month with the soil feeling pretty dry. It doesn't get direct sunlight, with the window facing north-east. Montreal is the city.

Thank you for any help.

I'm hoping to get some advice on what plants would have the best chance of survival in my room. 

I have two main spots where I keep my plants, and below I'll split them into groups based on their spot and how well they're doing. 

I'm hoping that based on that you might be able to advise me on what other plants I could get. 

Apologies in advance, when I refer to the window I'm not sure which way is it facing; what I can say though is that it mostly gets light in the afternoon, and usually its not very strong, apart from summer months when it's more intense. 

Location 1: shelves across the window,  about 3 metres away, supplied with growlights for a couple of hours a day 

Thriving:
- Satin Pothos (Scindapsus Pictures Argyreus)
- Peperomia Piccolo Banda
- Peperomia Rosso
- Cylindrical snake plant 

Doing okay:
- Snake Plant
- Ginseng ficus
- Hoya Bella (although a little droopy recently)
- Golden Pothos (but he's a very slow grower these days) 

Struggling:
- Asparagus Sataceus 

Too early to tell:
- Monstera Deliciosa 

Dead or not well:
- Tradescantia Nanouk
- Haworthias
- Aloes 

Location 2: by the window, fairly good light throughout the day 

Thriving:
- Parlour Palm
- Hoya Krimson Princess (although early days still, she's only a cutting)
- Boston Fern
- Aglaonema Prestige 

Doing well:
- Crassula Ovata

Doing so so:
- Oxalis Triangularis (grew some new shoots and then went dormant again?) 

Dead:
- Spider Plant (although due to other factors and not sun needs) 

I'm mostly looking for suggestions on plants that would do well in Location A, but will take any and all suggestions!

Thanks in advance :)"

houseplants,Need help caring for my late grandmother’s plants,"I’ve been procrastinating on making this post because it’s been making me anxious but here we go! Sorry in advance for all the questions and shitty pictures.

My grandma suddenly passed away about a month ago (it sucks). She lived with my parents and I often went home to spend time with them especially recently I was spending months at a time with them, because I also live in the same state. Her biggest hobby, pride and joy, were her plants. I spent this summer gardening with her, moving all the outdoor plants inside anticipate for winter, just watching her admire the houseplants, all of it. I myself am not the best at plant keeping (the pothos in my apartment never lives) but I was trying to learn a little from my grandma! Now that she’s gone, she’s left a bunch of beautiful plants here that I am just nervous are going to die in our care. My mom, like me, is not that good with plants. So far I think with overwatering we already killed one off. Some of the plants are yellowing and it just hurts my heart.

I know some basics from friends. I’ve been checking the soil from time to time too see if it’s particularly dry then I will water it. I’ve been told by a few people, I think my grandma too back in the day, that these plants only need to be watered once a week or every other week? Either way, I feel pretty lost without her guidance and seeing these plants weaken makes my stressed! It could just be winter and the lack sunlight doing them in, but I want to make sure I take care of them, and teach my mom how to, as best as possible.

If any of y’all could help, could you please look through the album below of plants in our home and give me some insight on what type of plant it is, what kind of sunlight it needs and how often they should be watered? Also any notes on temperatures needed to keep the plants healthy? I wonder if the heat in our house may be hurting some of these guys, since it’s now winter and the heats cranked up and some of the plants (like the pothos) are near the vent. I will be watering all the plants a little today to just have this be a starting point. If you read the pic captions I give some descriptions on what I’m noticing.

[https://imgur.com/a/kmOnHvq](https://imgur.com/a/kmOnHvq)

Overall I just want to maintain what she had going on. Like I mentioned, some of the plants were actually sitting outside, and thriving, but we had to move them in for the winter. So any insight on if I should move these back out when the weathers nice again is helpful! Also, any insight on how to stabilize plants is also helpful. As you will see there's a big beautiful plant that has been in this house for years and it just keeps growing. As you can see in the pics my grandma used to stabilize them by tying the base parts together but the other week I noticed that the plant had completely bent over because I think it’s gotten too tall. I got my dad to tie it up a little so the plant stays up but I wonder if there’s some other piece of equipment to use so that it can grow straight up and properly. I found this stick in our basement (also pictured) that I am thinking of sticking in the soil and tying yarn around to keep everything together.

Thank you for staying with me this whole time and any kind thoughts or advice is much appreciated!!"

Searching around the internet we found the  Silverleaf whitefly to be quite similar, but we're not sure that's the case.

Does anyone know what they could be and how to deal with them? If it helps in any way, we're living in Brazil and it's quite hot right now.

houseplants,Complete beginner with a few questions,"So I got a monstera deliciosa out of the blue, and I just put it on the porch and watered it without doing much (any) research. It bloomed fast and hard. I thought, *shit, I have a green thumb*. 

I now have a venus fly trap, a couple of pothos, and a red aglaonema. I do not have a green thumb. Some problems below:

The venus fly trap seems to be doing alright now; didn't start out that way. It's placed on an east facing porch (lots of sunlight in early hours). A few of the 'mouths' turned black immediately and I pruned them off and it's seemingly been fine for a few weeks. I'm giving it a bit of distilled water every day. No problems since the first few days but now one mouth is closed and yellowish. Warning sign?

Couple of pothos, a couple leaves are turning yellow (one case starting to brown) and drooping. One is on an east facing porch (in the shade during light), the other in a west facing room (mostly dim light all around). Am I overwatering, over/under sunlighting, etc?

Red aglaonema, no problem so far. Same room as latter pothos, though gets more westward sunset light. Any tips on keeping it that way?

Thanks for any nuggets of info; I'm really new to plants and would like to keep these around as long as I can!

PS. trying to propogate the now giant monstera for my dad. It's been about a week and a half, with no change to either the original plant, nor the piece I cut. The piece I cut was what I believe under the node; a little noodle is poking out from under it and it looks like the other bits that are burrowing into the soil. I have it in a glass and am changing the water every other day; I guess I'm just eager to see if it's going to start sprouting roots soon? Or if I just straight up murdered it.

Please advise, thank you"

I got my string of pearls and hearts a couple weeks ago and I initially sprayed them down with insecticidal soap because I found a spider mite on one of them, and all has been ok until now.


What I need help with:
1. How likely is it that the neighbouring plants are infected too even if they weren’t touching? 

2. Insecticidal soap worked wonders for my mites but I read that mealy bug eggs and larvae are in the soil too so would insecticidal soap work? And if it won’t any suggestions for other methods?

houseplants,Croton Transplant Shock,"Just moved from NY to Chicago and took many of my plants with me. This includes two crotons - a Petra and Eleanor Roosevelt - which seem to have been pretty badly affected by the drive out and I'd like to see if anyone on here has any tips for or experience with helping crotons recover from transplant shock.

- The Petra has lost most of its leaves but a few of the younger leaves are still hanging on and look pretty healthy. Before the move, it was in really really good shape (3 flowers came out in the dead of winter) and was not experiencing any leaf loss beyond what one would expect naturally. I'm not planning on really doing anything with this guy besides giving it lost of humidity and sun, but let me know if there's anything I can do to make sure its condition doesn't worsen and it ends up on a path to recovery.

- The Eleanor Roosevelt has lost pretty much all of its leaves. There are still a few that are not totally dried out but I think they'll probably die off in the next few days. However, if I scratch the bark of the plant, there is still green flesh underneath which tells me the plant is not totally dead yet. Before the move, this one was in pretty good shape though a few leaves were turning yellow and falling off, probably just due to the fact that it's winter. Should I try trimming this one back (and if so how much?) or just let it chill and pray for the best?


A bit of background on the move itself:

- Seeing as it's been very cold in this part of the country recently, I boxed all of them up and kept them in the climate-controlled truck cabin for the entire ride. 
- My truck actually broke down midway through the drive and had no heat for about 2.5h, which briefly exposed all plants in the cabin to slightly-below-freezing temperatures (say 25-30 deg F) for about 1.5h.
- I stayed overnight in a hotel and brought all the plants inside with me. In so doing, they were exposed to well-below-freezing temperatures (10-15 deg F) for a minute or two.
- There were many other plants in the cabin with me: pilea, jade, red banana, oxalis, pregnant onion. These all seem to be adjusting very well with the exception of the banana plant, which is suffering a little bit but I think should be fine.

houseplants,SOS MLT is on its last branches!,"Hi everyone.

I’ve posted here many times before, and thanks to all who took the time to comment on what they think the problem is.

Quick background: the Meyer Lemon Tree has been indoors since I live in Boston, and at first it was doing well in the nursery pot. It has a grow light and it even blossomed and started to show the beginnings of a little fruit. Then, leaves started falling and drying out, and I was concerned that it was either root rot or too dry, so I took it out and transferred it to a terracotta clay pot because I read these are the best to avoid root rot. 

She then still kept getting worse and now is completely leafless. I figured that maybe the soil at the time (Miracle Grow all purpose) was retaining too much water as some redditors suggested, so I changed the soil to cactus and succulent soil that also mentions is good for citrus trees. I fertilized it when it was in the Miracle Grow soil and this as was about 2.5 weeks before I changed to the cactus soil. I didn’t want her to get fertilizer burn as I read is a thing, so I left her alone. She receives 12 hrs of grow light a day, and just today I decided it’s time to re fertilize her with espoma since everything else I’ve tried isn’t working. 

Please take a look at the video with the link provided. She’s a mess, but I’m also confused about the black/dark spots on the brown/dying branches. Any help/insight is greatly appreciated!! I just have to get her through the winter so I can put her outside.

After the initial repot, it wasn't shedding as fast and seemed to be doing well but now don't know what to do.  Googling didn't come up of anything useful since I don't know what to call it.  Google lens didn't help either.

Looking at it seems only one of the three in the pot is exhibiting this colouration.

houseplants,Thoughts on nursery pots?,"Okay so I am fairly new to my houseplant journey and bought a bunch of gorgeous glazed ceramic pots, but they only have one hole in the bottom for drainage. I transplanted a peperomia piccolo banda into one and even with good draining soil it held onto so much water and got root rot and died. Twice. My other plants in ceramic pots are more tropical and enjoy the moisture (M. adonsonii and calathea, plus a few others) but when I got my m. Deliciosa and pilea moon valley I opted to keep them in the nursery pots since there's lots and lots of drainage holes at the bottom and I'll be devastated if they got overwatered. Should I be keeping my plants in nursery pots and just putting those in the pretty pots as decoration? Or are the ceramics fine and my watering schedule is to blame? Thanks in advance!"

anyone experience with a monstera deliciosa climbing something flexible for example a thick rope instead of a moss pole? 
i would like to train mine to climb a curved line and a rope with maybe some wire sounded good, also thought about a rope attached to the ceiling for climbing, but idk if it needs that climbing support buried like moss poles are and if it can be moving like swinging a bit like the rope would?

There are so many conflict informations...so I'm a bit confused

houseplants,Outdoor plants repotting gone wrong - please help!,"After i did repotting - the plants always end up wilting (leaf went soft, wet and too moist).

Basically i live in Australia which is currently in Summer, however the weather seems pretty bad lately, strong wind, cloudy and kinda just random. I use Terracota pot mostly and this potting mix [Osmocote Premium Potting Mix](https://www.lovethegarden.com/au-en/product/scotts-osmocote-premium-potting-mix-25l) mixed with perlite. I did water the plants before repotting, slowly untangle if possible otherwise i cut the bottom of root bound plants. Then, moved them onto a new pot - added the soil gently without packing too hard, i did lightly tap the pot to help it settle, after that i water them just a little bit in the middle right under the plants and leave the plants in sheltered place for a few days.

I checked them daily, the soil still a bit moist after 3 days so i refrain watering them, the plants still fine and healthy at this stages but then after that it all start wilting. 

What did i do wrong?

1. Since the plants was sheltered, is it not getting enough sunlight?
2. I notice there is white powder/crystal all over the potting mix, Could i it be bad batch of potting mix?
3. Should i not water at all after repotting?
4. Do i repot them at the wrong time? Summer? Most of plants i bought is kinda random anything that is flowering. They are all root bound though.

Thanks"

After the shower, I saw lots of small, slender, silvery insects crawling on the soil that didn't look like fungus gnats. I had presumed maybe thrips? I try to only water when the soil is dry and all pots have good drainage.

My next move is to try wiping down the leaves with a diluted soap solution and giving another shower. I'm wondering if there's a better way to care or eliminate the pest? A lot of scaring and holes have appeared on the leaves and I'm worried for them.

Thank you for any insight!

What's causing this browning and can I stop it?


Got this plant as a very kind house warming gift. Unfortunately, the giver didn't know we only have north facing windows. The windows are very big so we do get lots of light but I wouldn't describe it as bright.

Online advice says over watering or under watering (super helpful!)

I've been avoiding watering too much as I've killed plants by over watering before but The leaves feel very papery where they are browning. 

Thanks for any help :)"

As of today, roughly 2 weeks into propagation, I've noticed a subtle white film surrounding the points of cutting (in the picture it is not as easily discernible). I was wondering if this was possibly rot, and if so how I could remedy it? Is my Pothos a lost cause? I changed the water as soon as I noticed, but I'm worried, if it is a bad sign, that it is already too late. Thanks!

After a while, I noticed the lower leaves became super delicate and would fall off if I even brushed against them. Sometimes they turned a lighter colour first, but not always, some normal looking ones still fall off. I did some research and it seemed like it might I have been shocking the plant bc I was letting it get too dry between waterings, so I tried to keep it moist between watering with misting (the soil a bit too) but now the leaves are folding, and I’m worried that’s due to over watering. As of now I’m just monitoring the soil and watering when I first notice it’s dry (which seems to happen faster than my other plants because the pot is *so* small). I’d had a humidifier on, but I found that it kept my other plants overly moist. I just don’t know what to do, and would love any advice on what I can do for this guy. Thank you!"

I have a lovely sunroom/atrium in my house that is perfect for all my tropical plants any my vegetable starters. I also have a small indoor pond. 
In the last year, I had some white flies appear on some of my pond plants and unfortunately decimated them. Since then, they’ve spread to tomatoes, basil, Cana lilies, sundew, sage, and my Monstera and pothos. I’ve been using neem oil as well as a mixture of dawn/Alcohol/h2o. I’ve had no luck!

I haven't seen anything like this going around yet, so I apologize if someone has already started a trading place for Texans that have lost house plants due to the nastiness of mother nature and the power outages.

The form to fill out is here: [https://forms.gle/q8pVfL1fx167xZQ1A](https://forms.gle/q8pVfL1fx167xZQ1A)

The raw responses are here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-jWfeDdS9lc1o9y8JIh0bgcOrrYW7i7FB-2SVmn2LR0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-jWfeDdS9lc1o9y8JIh0bgcOrrYW7i7FB-2SVmn2LR0/edit?usp=sharing)

I'll format the responses to show which plants are needed by each individual, but I'll try to reach out to people who have the most overlap and get them talking.

They’re all growing new leaves even in winter. I found the perfect spots for them- originally calathea was getting crispy so I moved her a few feet further back from the windows.

[Put a few stem cuttings in water.](https://i.imgur.com/tXlHFnM.jpg) They're single stems with one node and a couple leaves that were on their way out to begin with (the plant was too young and damaged to get anything better). Roots have grown directly out of the stem itself (the stem looks hairy). Lo and behold, today I see baby leaves! Hallelujah!

I moved them to leca propagation, but is there any hope of this growing to a full plant from this? Idk if roots growing out of the stems are enough to begin a whole new plant or if I needed 2 nodes, one for leaves and one for roots. Also should I leave the dying yellow leaves? Idk if they're providing anything for the babies or if they're just taking up resources at this point."

Recently, I noticed some of the leaves drooping and softening, which is strange since normally they're tall and firm. Today I tried gently pulling one of unhealthy looking leaves out and to my horror, an entire clump came out very easily. I then went around the rest of the plant to see if the rest of it was fine... loads more leaves and clumps came out super easily, with just a gentle tug. Now it half of it is gone and some of the remaining leaves are still drooping.

Here's an image of what it looks like now: http://imgur.com/a/pRkQmmW

houseplants,[Pics] How I run my plant ICU shelf + progress of Philodendron Scandens coming back from dead,"Long story short: I ordered a heart Philodendron, it arrived via post during the worst of this years winter outbreak. It was in transit for a week in temperatures like -15 celsius. Needless to say it was dead: half of it yellow and dried out, the other half completely wilted and about to die too.    


I decided to chop it down into pieces and propagate what's left of it. All of the cuttings went onto my **plant ICU** which is a small shelf in my bedroom dedicated to saving hopeless cases. It has a nice delicate light in the morning and it's the first thing I see when I wake up. I spray it with water twice a day and check on it anytime I get up or go to bed.   


I divided the cuttings into four ""units"" and note on the progress once a week. Some patients can move the units if they improve (or degrade) not to affect other cuttings or not to be affected by other cuttings. I use filtered water only and I change it every 5 days max, I also add a microscopic amount of fertiliser. So [this](https://imgur.com/a/qA2DBNy) and [this](https://imgur.com/a/iK81Key) are progress pic one month later. Unfortunately no starting pic :(   


From the left in the pics the plant IC units are:

* left, back: cuttings with leaves that will definitely make it to be planted: healthy roots, healthy aerial roots (6/13 survived)
* left, front: stem cuttings only that will definitely make it to be planted: healthy roots, healthy aerial roots (do you see that baby leaf there?!?!?!) (2/10 survived)
* right, front: cuttings pulled from under soil: high change of mould if something goes wrong - this one looks good though! (1/4 survived)
* right, back: patients in critical state: some roots are about to rot but the aerial roots are still growing. (5 still fighting, many died after being here)

&amp;#x200B;

So ladies and gentlemen: I am pleased to announce this mission impossible has been a success, even though most of the cuttings didn't make it - I will soon plant my very first Philodendron Scandens &lt;3"

In my room, sunlight hits by bouncing off a white wall towards my stuff something like this, the considered ""Bright indirect light""

[https://www.ourhouseplants.com/imgs-content/light-guide-drawing-large.jpg](https://www.ourhouseplants.com/imgs-content/light-guide-drawing-large.jpg)

So I was wondering:

The infrared/visible sunlight as far as I know, it can heat things up, in summer here we reach temperatures of 35 °C

Does this mean that the sunlight would make them catch that temperature (35°C or above) if i open the windows 1 or 2 hours to ventilate?

The room temperature usually is 26/27°C, should I be concerned that it's get quite hot? Someone experienced that the plants gets a lot of hot or something like that?

Thanks in advance"

houseplants,Need help with care for an Orchid,"Hello all! Let me preface by saying I'm not really a gardener, and my indoor cats make it pretty difficult to have any wonderful plants inside the house, and I've only ever rented so far. I've had mostly failures with planting and gardening, but I do have a lovely hibiscus bush/tree that I planted in a large fabric pot outside, along with a planter of some lilies. I suck at growing herbs. BUT something strange and remarkable has happened.

About a year ago, I bought an orchid plant from Aldi (our grocery store). It was beautiful, it lived for a while, even got that orchid food spray for them too. Flowers shed, but I figured hey, the leaves are still green, let me keep it and see if it'll stay alive. I haven't re-potted or re-planted it because, well, it doesn't really go in a pot of dirt. It's still in the same pot with moss that it's been in since last year, and I've been awful with taking care of it, but I'd water it and spray it with food when I can think of it. It's on the window ledge by the sink, which is the only sunny window we have in the house that the cats can't easily get to and don't really bother going for.

So here's where my astonishment comes in.... IT'S GROWING BUDS!!! It's got some stems coming out, going a bit sideways, but they are growing buds!!! I can't believe I didn't kill this beautiful creature.

HOW DO I KEEP IT ALIVE?? Better yet, what should I do to help it thrive better? I'm sure the poor roots need some TLC.

Please help this novice!! TIA

houseplants,THRIP HELP!!,"Hi everyone, so recently on a couple of my plants I have noticed some thrip larvae and even some adolescent thrip.. there’s no poop or damage on any leaves or plants, so I know they’re new. 

I have washed all affected plants, and I wipe their leaves and petioles and stems every day to get anything new off, but I know that’s not enough. I have also isolated these plants and  I’m watching every other plant now too. 

I don’t know if it matters or not, but so far I’ve only noticed them on 4 of my coriaceous Anthuriums, 1 thick-leaved Philo, and 2 thin-leaves Philos. Maybe they’re more prone to them? 

Any tips and info on these bastards and how to eradicate them would be AMAZING, I know they’re a pain in the ass to deal with once they’re established, but since it’s only the early stages and it’s just a couple little white larvae crawling around, I figured I might be able to prevent an outbreak of them if I act fast... I do not want to deal with these once they’re established..."

It had gorgeous leaves, but they show all the dust so I have to clean them all the time. New leaves are definitely not as nice as the old ones. Cannot be sprayed with tap water, too much chalk. All the leaf tips are brown. Too much water, too little? No clue. some laves have little scars on them, as if they were folded and snapped or something. And 2 days ago, spider mites. Where did they come from? I checked all my other plants, nothing. Just this one. I literally rubbed every single leaf so I can spray it with Anti-mite thing. It took forever cause even though the plant looks so miserable it has 7 million leaves. What does my plant want?"

houseplants,Please Help,"Hi all.  My mom died on Tuesday.  She was a huge houseplant person and frequented this subreddit.  She has left behind 85 houseplants.  

She left some instructions on how to take care of them, and I spent the last year after she got sick learning from her on how to properly care for them (ex watering African violets with room temp water from the bottom).  She also gave away a ton of plants over the past year.  She had probably over 200 plants when she first got sick.  She was the type of person to take a leaf that fell off a plant and put it in water to grow a new plant, so there are multiples of a lot of the plants.

Even though I know the basics, the sheer number of plants has me feeling overwhelmed.  She told me it's okay if some of them die, but I would like to keep as many of them alive as I can, obviously.  Does anyone have any good tips on how to keep track of watering schedules and such?  I will also be moving in the spring so any advice on how to move a buttload of plants across the country is also very welcome.  

She has a wide variety of plants, from succulents to African violets to spider plants and a bunch of plants I can't remember the names of.  

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me!"

In Singapore, you can purchase Pothos N'Joy for as low as SGD$5-$10 , but I've seen some US website selling them for USD$59! Is the price hike only seen in online retailers or are plants equally expensive in physical stores in your country? I'm just curious !"

houseplants,My apartment is of the last few to get power back after Texas disaster. How can I save my plants?,"I’m so distraught. My place hasn’t had power since Sunday night, and thanks to an electrical fire, we don’t know when it’ll have power again. I have a small ikea greenhouse that we brought into the bedroom we were camping out in and I stuffed as many plants as I could into it. But I have a big BOP, monstera, rubber plant, blue cebu, etc that I couldn’t fit. 

I’ve worked so hard to find and properly care for my plants. Do you guys think they might make it? We had to leave our place because my husband and pets simply could not spend a sixth night in the freeze but obviously couldn’t bring my plants. I covered the greenhouse in blankets and tried to put trash bags over the bigger plants before we left tho. 

I plan on giving everyone a nice warm drink of water once I can. But idk what else to do. My rubber plant’s leaves all look ready to drop, my monstera looks deflated, my bigger pothos look slightly shriveled. I couldn’t make myself check in the greenhouse because I didn’t want to see how my stromanthe fared. I know I’m losing a calathea and a dieffenbachia for sure and I want to cry thinking about it. 

I’m sorry for the long rant. I have left all my items behind because of immigration twice now and never got those items back, so I have a lot of trauma about losing everything again, nevermind something I have poured so much love into. I’m absolutely torn to pieces about my plants. 

Any advice I would greatly appreciate."

houseplants,Moral question,"I travel for work. I recently stopped into a greenhouse four hours from home during some free time. I took some photos, including prices, and posted those along with my general impressions to my local fb group. I like to let people know if a particular nursery is worth the trip. 

Keen eyed members noticed a plant in one of the pictures that is very hard to get at home and quite popular. I had not planned to go back and buy anything but replied that if I had time I might go back and buy some.

Next day enough people had replied that I'm optimistic about buying some, so I drove back on my lunch break and bought fifteen plants for about ten bucks a piece. I went directly to several friends in the group and sold them the plant basically for cost. The remaining plants I listed for twenty dollars and sold them all in short order to happy people.

For the most part people understand that the time, transportation, and listing are all value added and a plant that has been unfindable locally is available. However I'm getting a lot of shit from people accusing me of being a flipper. What say you?"

houseplants,Need help caring for my late grandmother’s plants,"I’ve been procrastinating on making this post because it’s been making me anxious but here we go! Sorry in advance for all the questions and shitty pictures.

My grandma suddenly passed away about a month ago (it sucks). She lived with my parents and I often went home to spend time with them especially recently I was spending months at a time with them, because I also live in the same state. Her biggest hobby, pride and joy, were her plants. I spent this summer gardening with her, moving all the outdoor plants inside anticipate for winter, just watching her admire the houseplants, all of it. I myself am not the best at plant keeping (the pothos in my apartment never lives) but I was trying to learn a little from my grandma! Now that she’s gone, she’s left a bunch of beautiful plants here that I am just nervous are going to die in our care. My mom, like me, is not that good with plants. So far I think with overwatering we already killed one off. Some of the plants are yellowing and it just hurts my heart. 

I know some basics from friends. I’ve been checking the soil from time to time too see if it’s particularly dry then I will water it. I’ve been told by a few people, I think my grandma too back in the day, that these plants only need to be watered once a week or every other week? Either way, I feel pretty lost without her guidance and seeing these plants weaken makes my stressed! It could just be winter and the lack sunlight doing them in, but I want to make sure I take care of them, and teach my mom how to, as best as possible.

If any of y’all could help, could you please look through the album below of plants in our home and give me some insight on what type of plant it is, what kind of sunlight it needs and how often they should be watered? Also any notes on temperatures needed to keep the plants healthy? I wonder if the heat in our house may be hurting some of these guys, since it’s now winter and the heats cranked up and some of the plants (like the pothos) are near the vent. I will be watering all the plants a little today to just have this be a starting point. If you read the pic captions I give some descriptions on what I’m noticing. 

[https://imgur.com/a/kmOnHvq](https://imgur.com/a/kmOnHvq)

Overall I just want to maintain what she had going on. Like I mentioned, some of the plants were actually sitting outside, and thriving, but we had to move them in for the winter. So any insight on if I should move these back out when the weathers nice again is helpful! Also, any insight on how to stabilize plants is also helpful. As you will see there's a big  beautiful plant that has been in this house for years and it just keeps growing. As you can see in the pics my grandma used to stabilize them by tying the base parts together but the other week I noticed that the plant had completely bent over because I think it’s gotten too tall. I got my dad to tie it up a little so the plant stays up but I wonder if there’s some other piece of equipment to use so that it can grow straight up and properly. I found this stick in our basement (also pictured) that I am thinking of sticking in the soil and tying yarn around to keep everything together.

Thank you for staying with me this whole time and any kind thoughts or advice is much appreciated!!"

*I am new to reddit, so feel free to correct me if there once was a post similar to mine*

I wanted to share our love for all plants.

I find that I am one with nature more so than I thought (my nieces call me organic) 

I have always gardened with my dad, he taught me so much about the type of soil, types of plants that are good for our health and what not. 

its been a couple of years where my princess cleopatra (my cat) died and that's when I didn't want anymore animals and I just focused on being a plant mom. 

share your stories, what you love about your plants, your routine?

&amp;#x200B;

do you buy seeds? ready grown plants? do you just use your own used up vegetables to grow more around the house?  

&amp;#x200B;

I have different types of plant that need different care. I love them, I talk to them. tell them good morning (sounds crazy but feels good) I am always looking for the best light for them, since I live in a apartment but they have come a long way and they are all healthy and striving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but keep reminding myself of how plants have done so much for us when it comes to everything we do, breathe, eat, medicine, much more...

houseplants,"Low-light, cat safe house plants?","My wife and I live in a small apartment that doesn't get a whole ton of natural light. We used to have a bunch of succulents but we have a cat who likes to nibble on plants and most of them are highly toxic so we're down to a single echeveria and a haworthia, both of which are cat safe. I like house plants, especially now that I spend most of the day inside with winter and school. Our problem is finding plants that can tolerate low light and that we don't have to try to keep our cat away from (like we could anyway. He's figured out how to get pretty much anywhere he wants). Any recommendations for low-light, cat safe, preferably relatively low-maintenance indoor plants?

TL;DR: need plants that can tolerate low light conditions and won't kill my cat/make him sick"

houseplants,Soil type for sting of hearts?,"I posted about a new impulse string of hearts purchase I made about a week or so ago. I have discovered that it’s planted in a way that all of the soil runs straight out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. It’s in a very strange soil. Very gritty, looks like a lot of minerals. Pretty much like the sandy dirt from the beach near a creek. I need to repot this because so much soil came out in the one time I watered it the plant is down deep in the pot. What type of soil do these prefer? I have a few options on hand. Including bonsai soil (all rock/clay), coco coir, regular potting soil, and a houseplant blend that’s cactus soil, orchid mix, and coco coir blended together. Do they need to be slowly up potted or can I move up a size or two and have it spread to fill the space? It’s in a tiny 2 inch pot now. I have a 4 inch one available and also some 3 inch pots."

Then it got droopy and the leaves got soft/were falling off. So I obviously need to let this guy dry out a bit. I have it hanging by a south facing window, but we really haven't had much sun because of the constant snowy days. 

Is it a fussy plant? Should I just get it under a plant light? The soft leaves aren't going to firm back up, right?

Thanks."

houseplants,Lamp styles for grow lights?,"I'm looking to replace my gooseneck purple grow lights with some white grow lights on some aesthetically pleasing lamps.... Anyone have any recommendations? What kind of lamp shade to look for or avoid?  Really hoping to make my home look less like a grow house from 3 blocks over 😆

 I know it will vary a lot as far as how much light it's starting with and how much I need etc...  But some general guidelines would be super helpful

Lamp A: looking for one that will give off a significant amount of light for a leggy umbrella tree that I'm rescuing after a decade of minimal light and has really turned a corner since I put a grow light over it. Doesn't have to be super stylish, but I like it to look like it belongs..
 
Lamp B: Second one  I'd like to have a primarily pretty lamp that gives off a moderate amount   (A really beautiful classic library/office...just  need enough to keep some peace lilies and pothos growing ) it is the lower level of a split level home facing west so it gets very little light. It needs a lamp or two so I'm hoping that I can find some that will fill both needs rather than get some gooseneck ones that will really ruin the room.

Will a lampshade diffuse a bright grow light and give some plants scattered around the room the bit they would need?"

However, for quite some time I managed to keep my Clusia Rosea alive, but recently it started develop black spots on the leaves, especially the new ones. I am not sure if it is visible in the picture, but these spots are ""on the surface"", it is not discolouration. If I push it with the nail, they fall off leaving a small ""pit"" on the leaf.  I have no idea what it is and google search didnt give any results. I water it once a week. Your help would be much appreciated."

houseplants,Pothos repotting tips,So about 5 years or so ago I was gifted a pothos and it was the first plant I didn’t manage to kill. I’ve since successfully propagated many baby gifts over the years so it’s a little nostalgic to me.  Lately I can tell it’s unhappy and when I water it immediately runs through the drainage holes and the soil is never full moistened. I think (I know) I need to repot it but I’m absolutely scared to death! I feel like whenever I get brave with my plant shit on the weekend I always regret my decision :/ please give me tips and peace of mind! I have replanted some cuttings into the same pot within the last few months to try and fill her out and I just feel like the whole damn plan will crumble in my hands when I try and repot it and I will be sad as fuck!

Ive been a plant mom for about a year and haven’t had many issues yet. When I was watering tonight I noticed these bumps on my umbrella tree branches. They pop off if I force them. I am wondering if it is scale? There are no bugs I can see on the leaves, and I’ve seen/read different people’s experiences and I’m wondering if it could just be bark forming? They are only on the thicker stems, and as it goes up goes from round shapes to little stripes. 
I am going to treat it and isolate it just to be sure. Any info you all have would be very much appreciated!"

houseplants,PSA: moisture meters are not always reliable!,"I bought the most common moisture meter I see on here a while back. I relied on it heavily. It seemed pretty accurate...in my old, miracle gro or Vigoro generic potting mix, straight from the bag.

Now, I use miracle gro cactus soil mixed with a lot of perlite and worm castings. My plants seem to like it, it drains well and it stays light and doesn’t pack down. I also moved last November when I made the soil change. Initially I was bad and watered with tap water. I’ve come to observe this tap water may have a lot of salts and minerals in it.

I kept using my trusty meter. But I started to raise an eyebrow when it kept claiming some of my plants were “wet”...mostly the bigger plants. I didn’t water my bigger stuff for OVER A MONTH because it kept jumping right up to “wet” and like any houseplant owner, I was freaking out that I might get root rot! I did eventually start using my finger too, but I guess I was tricked by the reading on the meter to thinking it felt slightly moist. Also, since this soil mix is very loose, it’s not always super easy to tell if it’s MOIST moist or just holding a lil bit of water but not really moist.

Finally I googled. And moisture meters don’t actually read moisture like I thought. Perhaps I’m late to the game and you all know this already. But for those of you that don’t, this is a PSA meant to help you save some sad plants.

Here’s the link that taught me what I needed to know:

[moisture meter explained](https://www.ohiotropics.com/2020/01/03/soil-moisture-meters-indoor-plants/)

TL:DR Moisture meters don’t actually read moisture. Because of this, they can be completely wrong because of other factors like minerals/salts in your soil and water. Get used to using your finger."

houseplants,ELI5: How does “direct sun” “indirect sun” “part shade” etc. translate when exclusively using grow lights?,"Explain this to me like I’m 5 years old, literally. I can’t find many answers, and even fewer answers that are easy to understand. I’m a simple human. Ok, well I’m smart enough. But the nitty gritty of artificial lights for plants is often way too complicated and I can’t really understand it.

So say you have no sunlight at all and are only using LED full spectrum grow lights. Would “indirect sun” or “part shade” plants need to be protected the same from the LED lights as the sun? Or can the plants take the full light from grow lights? How long is best to leave LED grow lights on?

I’ve had many grow lights of varying sizes and brightness over a wide variety of plants- from veggie plants and herbs, to cacti, to typical tropical houseplants. So far I haven’t had a problem, that I know of, exposing all plants to LED grow lights directly for 14-16 hours a day. I’ve had the lights range from 4” away providing direct light and across a narrow hall, giving indirect light. But some of my plants are getting a bit moody and it’s time I figure this out so I can individualize plant care rather than just give them all similar care and hope for the best.

Please make this as simple as possible for me, I’m so frustrated reading articles that go too in depth, are way over my head, and don’t even give any answers.

If you don’t even know how it works but you use LED grow lights for houseplants, I’d love to hear what has worked for you.

Thank you!"

houseplants,Repotting Plants,"Hi,

New plant mama here...What type of containers/pots do you use when you hang your plants with macrame holders? 

I keep reading that most plants require pots with drainage holes, but if they're hanging how do you avoid the water dripping on the floor? Do pots with flat trays/drainage tray at the bottom of them sit well in macrame holders? Do I need to buy a plastic container with drainage holes and then put that into another pot with no holes?

I have a spider plant I'm waiting to repot and I'm not sure what type of pot to get if I'm hanging it up. I've never repotted my other plants either and they all have a plastic container with holes that sit in a 2nd pot with no drainage holes. I think its time to repot them, but I don't know what type to get.

For reference- I have a spider plant, money tree, pilea glauca, a chrysanthemum, and two succulents."
