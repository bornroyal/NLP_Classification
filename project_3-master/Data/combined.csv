houseplants,Calathea Rufibarba Repotting Question,"New Plant Mom -

Current picture of plant: https://imgur.com/gallery/jKuvTUC

In January I stopped by my local grocery store and this velvety plant caught my eye. I was like well while I‚Äôm stuck at a home like the old days, I might as well see if I can keep a plant alive. I identified the plant I chose as a Calathea Rufibarba. So I have been mindful of watering with filtered water and light exposure. 
      
However, I feel like it needs to be repotted. I mean it came from a grocery store so I‚Äôm sure the soil mix is nothing special. It‚Äôs also in a 5 in planter pot, and I can see some root action coming through the drainage holes. 

I‚Äôve read they can be finicky plants and don‚Äôt want repotting to be my downfall. So far I have some miracle gro indoor potting mix and perlite. 
I‚Äôve found many different soil mixtures for calathea, thus why I‚Äôm confused. 
Should I just try some potting soil, perlite and moss?
Or orchid bark? 


And how exactly should I be watering?
I‚Äôve also been bottom watering, not sure if this is the best idea for this specific plant but .

Extra Info:
Since I‚Äôve had it three new leaves have come out, although they are not in good condition. Light green, thin, brown edges.

houseplants,My Bamboo looks horrible and seems to suffer a lot. I tried a lot of different approaches but nothing has worked so far :(,"Hello, my favorite plant is my moso bamboo and I feel awful about its condition. I bought the plants 3 years ago and it has been a struggle ever since. If you could help me save it, it would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance!

Of the ~15 seedlings (seed with fresh sprout up to 10cm plants) only 7 survived after I planted them in a big pot with normal flower soil with a bit of compost and garden soil. It stayed wet for way too long and the bamboo didn't like that. As they all seemed to die I decided to change the soil. After reading multiple guides about growing bamboo I mixed up some soil after instructions from a bamboo farm that also grows bamboo in pots/containers (they had percentages for garden earth, flower soil, sand, compost, + some minor additions). Only the biggest 4 plants survived the replanting. They were 15-20 cm at the time and had 3-4 thin stalks.

Over the next ~2 years, one by one 3 of them died as well, the last one over the last weeks.

When I water the pot, most of the water immediately drains into the soil, and if I pour in a bit more than 100ml, it quickly drains to the flower pot coaster. Despite this, the soil always stays a bit damp and never dries out completely even if I don't water the pot for many months.


It was always close to a window (I even tried growing it under a timed growing lamp) so I think light isn't the issue. I had it in my room or a hallway and the temperature also didn't seem to matter. Bamboo fertilizer also showed no effects.

My bamboo grows one or two new shoots every ~6 months. They grow really well for a couple of weeks. Then they suddenly stop growing and 2 months later the fresh tips and leaves dry out and half of the fresh leaves and stalks die. Then the plant goes into hibernation and won't have any visible changes until the next shoots grow. I cut back the fully dead stalks to keep track of what died recently.

A while after all of the paint started bubbling up and we could just wipe off the paint with a tissue. Did she do anything wrong in the process? In case that isn't a good sealer for this purpose, do you have any recommendations for other ones that I could get? I am from western Europe.

I've had these plants in their original/plastic potters sitting on top of pebbles/rocks in a decorative ceramic pot for a while now. 

Should I be considering transplanting them out of the potters and into the pots themselves? I like keeping them in potters, becuase it's really easy to pull them out and water them in a sink or something which easily allows them to drain. 

If I transplanted them, then I would have to rely on the pebbles/rocks at the bottom to catch the excess water and then drain them by taking the stopper out of the bottom. 

But I'm also worried that I'm restricting growth by leaving them in the relatively small potters. 

Any thoughts or suggestions? I guess I'm just worried that if I transplant, the drainage won't be as good or sufficient and proper drainage has always been my downfall in maintaining houseplants. These are actually some of the first house plants that I've consistently kept alive for at least half a year.",9

I moved recently and my new place has a porch before/beside the front door. There's a small space (65 x 65 cm, ceiling height) that's kind of going to waste. It gets a lot of sun, since it is south facing with little to no obstruction to the sunlight coming in.  We've nicknamed it the sun trap. 
I live in Ireland so it is not sunny all the time, but when it is, this spot gets it all day. 

I'm looking for some input on plants that could be nice to keep there. Anyone entering the house would come past it so I figured some greenery would be nice! Maybe a narrow shelving unit with some cacti? I read they do well with lots of sun.

I'm a novice when it comes to keeping plants. I've a ficus that has come back from the dead a few times (overwatering...) and I have managed to keep some herbs alive in the kitchen window. But anything too advance I might kill..

I have changed the location of the Calathea a few times looking for better spots. It's currently in a secluded spot where the sunlight is indirect for the most part of the day.

I recently bought a bird of paradise and my Bengal cat quickly found interest and started to nibble. I looked online for suggestions on how to stop this and people suggested mixing a diluted solution of vinegar and water to spray on the leaves. I did this but then noticed that the plant‚Äôs leaves curled a bit the next day and looked generally dry. I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôve harmed the leaves on the plant and at the same time, my cat keeps eating it! How do you guys safely keep your cats away from eating your plants? Thank you in advance!",7

houseplants,Plant ideas for an indoor trellis?,"I have a beam in my bedroom that I bought a new pot and a little modular trellis for, and was intending to plant my English ivy in. When I was reading up on it today, I came across something that said that English ivy is seriously toxic for pets, which is bad as I have a cat and dog that I worry would chew on or eat a fallen leaf. 

I‚Äôve been trying to google for plant ideas to replace an ivy, and I keep seeing articles that basically recommend pothos, philodendrons, or wandering Jews (and then warn that they‚Äôre all too heavy for a trellis), and then just recommend a lot of varieties of ivy. 

All of this to say, does anyone know of a plant that would work well on a trellis but wouldn‚Äôt make my pets very sick if it dropped a leaf? Has anyone tried a pothos, philodendron, or wandering Jew to know if they work well on a trellis?

houseplants,Fungus Gnat SOS/Desperation,"I know there are many posts on here about fungus gnats and how to treat them and I feel a little bad about making another one. But what do you do when nothing seemingly works? A couple of months ago I repotted most of my houseplants with new soil, which was definitely infested with larvae. In the past month alone I have gone through 6 bottles of hydrogen peroxide, 6 packages of yellow sticky traps, 4 gallons of mosquito bit tea, drying them out, etc. I have put gravel/tiny rocks on some, but they still get gnats  I have used neem oil (which did successfully kill a small mealy bugs outbreak!). Nothing seems to work and they only seem to worsen. 

I am very close to choosing the few that are unaffected and that are dear to me (about 10 out of 50) and setting the rest outside with a FREE SIGN. I feel incredibly guilty about getting rid of them, but it has reached panic attack level infestation. They land on me while I am working and in bed, on my computer, etc. I spend most of my weekends scrubbing dirt and hydrogen peroxide spills off my apartment floor. The plants themselves are happy, they ALL have new growth. Calatheas are a little crispy on some leaf tips, but aren't they all. It's almost like I need permission to just let them go. It makes me feel like a failure when I have spent so much time, energy, and money. Trying to tell myself that they helped fill a void in my life when I needed them and was depressed and I am doing better now. But it feels like I am dropping off a pet I have had for a year at the shelter and driving away. I have 2 cats, one who has some medical issues, so I am not a stranger to responsibility. 

Can anyone relate to this desperation???",3

I bought a ficus lyrata and a ficus elastica from a seller on Etsy. The little rubber tree looks great, cannot wait to watch it thrive like the burgundy one I already have at home. I'm concerned about the fiddle leaf fig. It definitely looks cold. Both plants soil was pretty cold, the travelled to Alaska, so I'm not surprised. But some of the leaves have brown spots/holes or little white dots.

Both plants are quarantining in my bedroom for a while. Is there something to be concerned with for the lyrata or could it all just be travel stress?

I have a TON of these little bugs crawling around in the soil of a couple plants. The photo has two you can see circled in red, crawling on the green rim of the pot. They appear to be clear/beige, and about the size of a grain of sand.

The photo showing just one shows the outline more clear.

The plant is an elephant ear plant, and it is doing ok - not thriving though. I wipe the leaves clean every other week.

What are these and how do I cleanse my plant of them?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Looks like they may be springtails

houseplants,"In general, what's worse: shocking a plant with too much repotting, or allowing it to sit in the wrong soil mix for too long?","I would post this to /r/plantclinic but this is more of a general question, and they like when you keep it specific to one plant. I have a couple of plants that I recently adopted. With hardly any plant knowledge, I thought that I was doing the right thing by going to my local nursery, picking up an all purpose potting soil, and giving all of these plant babies some new nutrients to thrive on.

Now that I've been reading more, I think I did the wrong thing. Here's what the soil bag says: ""Why are we so proud of our all purpose potting soil? It's a screened, lightweight soil made in Minnesota, using North American peat, bark, and compost. It also contains aged rice hulls, a renewable resource to maintain porosity. And to top it off, it's approved for organic gardening"".

Doesn't sound terrible, but I have a mix of new plants with varying moisture requirements: spider plants, transcantia zebra, pothos, philodendron, aloe, haworthia zebra, pilea peperomioides, a peace lily, and a baby fig twig. I'm reading that I should have a mix of things like perlite/pumice/charcoal for plants that need more drainage, and things like coco coir/peat moss/orchid bark for plants that like to stay moist.   


So ideally I'd like to repot a couple of these plants, again, especially because some of them like a couple of the spider plants and the transcantia cuttings are in way too big of a pot, but I don't want to upset them any further by repotting too soon.  


Should I go ahead and amend the soil on these pots ASAP, or do you think it's best to wait and let the plants get accustomed to their new homes first? I'm thinking about future plants too, like taking stuff home from a nursury and wanting to tinker with the soil. If the answer is wait, how long?

It lost all its four leaves to cold damage/ trauma in the first two weeks! But I stuck with the little stump it had left, even taking it on my move to college and subjecting it to a 13 hr car ride.

Soon after it put out a new leaf! Then, two mornings ago, I woke up to find my cat had eaten the leaf-  so the plant is leafless for the second time (it was a very small leaf- so I wasn't worried about my cat's health too much). 

Does anyone have advice!! I put half a plastic water bottle over it for protection, and it has a new leaf that could unfurl, but just how hardy is this plant? It's still winter and I'm not sure it'll survive again to put out this new leaf...",2

houseplants,Texas freeze tried to kill all my houseplants,"During the freeze last week we lost power, and since we live in 110+ year old farmhouse the inside of the house was below freezing for over 24 hours before I was able to remove my plants. I have quite a few plants although most are pothos/ivy types and I have four of those that I‚Äôve inherited from my late Grandma and my wife‚Äôs late Grandmother that I would really like to save. Some have a couple of legs that survived, but is there any hope for the legs that seem dark and soft? I was unsure if I should even cut them back or risk letting the soft areas spread to the green parts that somehow survived under the surface. 

I also have a rubber tree plant that took a hard hit and decided to cut the stems until no squishy parts were left because it definitely seemed like parts that weren‚Äôt squishy last week were now squishy today. The rootball seems stable in the pot still so I was going to leave my pot of sticks (lol) to see if it produces leaves eventually. Is there anything that might help it come back? 

I‚Äôve never fertilized any of my plants, but most I‚Äôve accumulated in the last year or two so I just haven‚Äôt gotten around to researching what to add to them. I was so desperate to try to save some of my sentimental plants that I was melting snow and ice in a pot on the grill just so I could water them because I read that giving them moisture will help them recover. Of coarse none of the store bought plants took as hard of a hit as the sentimental ones, but all of them have at least one or two good legs left on them. At this point I would love to save anymore legs but I‚Äôm happy with what survived so none of them are completely gone besides one that was already struggling. They were all so gorgeous before because I had been putting so much love and effort into them, but hopefully with some time and love they‚Äôll be just as beautiful. 

Sorry if this was an odd post; it‚Äôs my first reddit post and I‚Äôm not entirely sure how this all works. Lol. I‚Äôm going to try to include a picture in the comments to see if anyone knows what to do with the vines that are discolored/soft. I was so destroyed to find them all in such bad shape that I was in tears; which I hate to admit, but me and my Grandma had such a connection with plants that I was devastated that I almost killed them within a few months of acquiring them. I hadn‚Äôt planned on cutting the legs on the one that she gifted me, but all of the legs on that one have gone soft besides one tiny new leaf that sprouted after she passed away. Thank you for understanding about my weird love for plants if you‚Äôve made it this far through my post, and I appreciate any advice y‚Äôall have. Thanks again! üíö",8

Anyway, I‚Äôve just started getting into house plants pretty hardcore over that past year. I‚Äôm self taught &amp; often have to sift thru loads of conflicting plant care info, so I‚Äôve kept my plant kids in the easy-to-keep alive genre. 
I‚Äôve always coveted prayer plants from afar but have been intimidated to take one on, especially after my Polka Dot plant used &amp; abused my love then crapped out on me. 
So give it to me straight- what has worked best for you &amp; your prayer plant?

houseplants,Moving with houseplants!,"Hello lovely people! I'm currently getting ready for a move about nine hours from where I live and am looking for some advice for traveling with my plants. I'll be doing the drive in one day and can easily fit them all into my car but I was wondering about the safest way to transport them? I've been thinking to just put them in open boxes in my back seat and strap them in with a seatbelt but if there are other options I'd definitely appreciate hearing some! I have a pretty large monstera and that's gonna be going on the floor of my passenger seat because it'll fit well there. The other plants are all relatively small and should be okay for the amount of time it'll take me to get to my final destination. I know that they'll probably be pretty stressed out once I get to where we're going, but that place is pretty humid and the home has tons of windows for different lighting options, and most of my plants are tropicals so they're be happy! I can't wait to see how they thrive in their new environment, especially since spring is approaching!

Has anyone else done this lately? Any advice is welcome and appreciated!",3

The scent of potting mix seems to have taken over my room, maybe when I water my plants im overwatering them or maybe I should water them in 1:1 intervals?

So I'm just gon' be real with y'all, self-isolation during the pandemic has been kicking my ass when it comes to my mental health. My social life has gone from 'best it's been in years' to 'I haven't seen my friends since March' and I'm in desperate need of something to keep me occupied in these sh*tty times.

The conclusion I've come to is that I want to start filling my apartment with houseplants. I need something to care for, something that'll give me some semblance of a healthy daily routine to keep me from going nuts for the coming months. The thing is that I have no idea where to start. I don't know what plants are good for beginners, what the prices are, where to get my hands on them, etc, etc. So I thought that I'd reach out to my fellow redditors with some (or a whole lot) more knowledge on the matter than me. Here's what my situation looks like:

‚Ä¢ I have 3 west-southwest facing windows illuminating everything but the entryway and bathroom. Walls are painted white so there's lots of light available. There's also plenty of unused floor, table and wall space.

‚Ä¢ I live in a northern climate (Scandinavia) with cold, dark winters and hot, bright summers. Mild to severe heat waves have been getting much more common here in recent years so any houseplants would have to be able to deal with the summer heat as there's no AC. Heating in winter is not an issue.

‚Ä¢ I'm currently out of a job and most likely won't be able to work again until after the pandemic has gotten under control, so price is a factor here. I'm not destitute but also can't go spending a fortune on plants.

‚Ä¢ I try going out as little as possible right now so any tips regarding online stores that ship within the EU would be greatly appreciated!

Any advice whatsoever on where and how I should start would mean the world to me. Again, I am a complete newb here so I'm not looking for anything that'll wither and die if I look at it funny, I'm not looking for a challenge. Also, please let me know if this is not the sub to post this in and kindly point me in the right direction if you know where I should turn instead, I don't wanna spam your community with unwanted content.

I found this guy left out for garbage pick-up this summer and took him home to add to my crew. I'm not sure what it is though.

Also, it seems to have degraded in some ways, as it has lost a fair bit of its needles and is yellowed slightly, though it's growing more, so not sure if it's just a seasonal thing in winter.

It seemed pretty succulent-like to me, so I haven't been watering it very much. Maybe once or twice a month with the soil feeling pretty dry. It doesn't get direct sunlight, with the window facing north-east. Montreal is the city.

Thank you for any help.

I'm hoping to get some advice on what plants would have the best chance of survival in my room. 

I have two main spots where I keep my plants, and below I'll split them into groups based on their spot and how well they're doing. 

I'm hoping that based on that you might be able to advise me on what other plants I could get. 

Apologies in advance, when I refer to the window I'm not sure which way is it facing; what I can say though is that it mostly gets light in the afternoon, and usually its not very strong, apart from summer months when it's more intense. 

Location 1: shelves across the window,¬† about 3 metres away, supplied with growlights for a couple of hours a day 

Thriving:
- Satin Pothos (Scindapsus Pictures Argyreus)
- Peperomia Piccolo Banda
- Peperomia Rosso
- Cylindrical snake plant 

Doing okay:
- Snake Plant
- Ginseng ficus
- Hoya Bella (although a little droopy recently)
- Golden Pothos (but he's a very slow grower these days) 

Struggling:
- Asparagus Sataceus 

Too early to tell:
- Monstera Deliciosa 

Dead or not well:
- Tradescantia Nanouk
- Haworthias
- Aloes 

Location 2: by the window, fairly good light throughout the day 

Thriving:
- Parlour Palm
- Hoya Krimson Princess (although early days still, she's only a cutting)
- Boston Fern
- Aglaonema Prestige 

Doing well:
- Crassula Ovata

Doing so so:
- Oxalis Triangularis (grew some new shoots and then went dormant again?) 

Dead:
- Spider Plant (although due to other factors and not sun needs) 

I'm mostly looking for suggestions on plants that would do well in Location A, but will take any and all suggestions!

Thanks in advance :)",9

houseplants,Need help caring for my late grandmother‚Äôs plants,"I‚Äôve been procrastinating on making this post because it‚Äôs been making me anxious but here we go! Sorry in advance for all the questions and shitty pictures.

My grandma suddenly passed away about a month ago (it sucks). She lived with my parents and I often went home to spend time with them especially recently I was spending months at a time with them, because I also live in the same state. Her biggest hobby, pride and joy, were her plants. I spent this summer gardening with her, moving all the outdoor plants inside anticipate for winter, just watching her admire the houseplants, all of it. I myself am not the best at plant keeping (the pothos in my apartment never lives) but I was trying to learn a little from my grandma! Now that she‚Äôs gone, she‚Äôs left a bunch of beautiful plants here that I am just nervous are going to die in our care. My mom, like me, is not that good with plants. So far I think with overwatering we already killed one off. Some of the plants are yellowing and it just hurts my heart.

I know some basics from friends. I‚Äôve been checking the soil from time to time too see if it‚Äôs particularly dry then I will water it. I‚Äôve been told by a few people, I think my grandma too back in the day, that these plants only need to be watered once a week or every other week? Either way, I feel pretty lost without her guidance and seeing these plants weaken makes my stressed! It could just be winter and the lack sunlight doing them in, but I want to make sure I take care of them, and teach my mom how to, as best as possible.

If any of y‚Äôall could help, could you please look through the album below of plants in our home and give me some insight on what type of plant it is, what kind of sunlight it needs and how often they should be watered? Also any notes on temperatures needed to keep the plants healthy? I wonder if the heat in our house may be hurting some of these guys, since it‚Äôs now winter and the heats cranked up and some of the plants (like the pothos) are near the vent. I will be watering all the plants a little today to just have this be a starting point. If you read the pic captions I give some descriptions on what I‚Äôm noticing.

[https://imgur.com/a/kmOnHvq](https://imgur.com/a/kmOnHvq)

Overall I just want to maintain what she had going on. Like I mentioned, some of the plants were actually sitting outside, and thriving, but we had to move them in for the winter. So any insight on if I should move these back out when the weathers nice again is helpful! Also, any insight on how to stabilize plants is also helpful. As you will see there's a big beautiful plant that has been in this house for years and it just keeps growing. As you can see in the pics my grandma used to stabilize them by tying the base parts together but the other week I noticed that the plant had completely bent over because I think it‚Äôs gotten too tall. I got my dad to tie it up a little so the plant stays up but I wonder if there‚Äôs some other piece of equipment to use so that it can grow straight up and properly. I found this stick in our basement (also pictured) that I am thinking of sticking in the soil and tying yarn around to keep everything together.

Thank you for staying with me this whole time and any kind thoughts or advice is much appreciated!!",8

I'm not sure if I'm posting on the right place, so sorry in any case!  
So we just bought this Texas Sage a week ago and today we realized its branches (and also some leaves) are full of these white pill shaped things, not sure if it's some kind of bug or larvae. It won't really move and it's quite small.

Searching around the internet we found the  Silverleaf whitefly to be quite similar, but we're not sure that's the case.

Does anyone know what they could be and how to deal with them? If it helps in any way, we're living in Brazil and it's quite hot right now.

houseplants,Complete beginner with a few questions,"So I got a monstera deliciosa out of the blue, and I just put it on the porch and watered it without doing much (any) research. It bloomed fast and hard. I thought, *shit, I have a green thumb*. 

I now have a venus fly trap, a couple of pothos, and a red aglaonema. I do not have a green thumb. Some problems below:

The venus fly trap seems to be doing alright now; didn't start out that way. It's placed on an east facing porch (lots of sunlight in early hours). A few of the 'mouths' turned black immediately and I pruned them off and it's seemingly been fine for a few weeks. I'm giving it a bit of distilled water every day. No problems since the first few days but now one mouth is closed and yellowish. Warning sign?

Couple of pothos, a couple leaves are turning yellow (one case starting to brown) and drooping. One is on an east facing porch (in the shade during light), the other in a west facing room (mostly dim light all around). Am I overwatering, over/under sunlighting, etc?

Red aglaonema, no problem so far. Same room as latter pothos, though gets more westward sunset light. Any tips on keeping it that way?

Thanks for any nuggets of info; I'm really new to plants and would like to keep these around as long as I can!

PS. trying to propogate the now giant monstera for my dad. It's been about a week and a half, with no change to either the original plant, nor the piece I cut. The piece I cut was what I believe under the node; a little noodle is poking out from under it and it looks like the other bits that are burrowing into the soil. I have it in a glass and am changing the water every other day; I guess I'm just eager to see if it's going to start sprouting roots soon? Or if I just straight up murdered it.

Please advise, thank you",6

What I need help with:
1. How likely is it that the neighbouring plants are infected too even if they weren‚Äôt touching?

houseplants,Croton Transplant Shock,"Just moved from NY to Chicago and took many of my plants with me. This includes two crotons - a Petra and Eleanor Roosevelt - which seem to have been pretty badly affected by the drive out and I'd like to see if anyone on here has any tips for or experience with helping crotons recover from transplant shock.

- The Petra has lost most of its leaves but a few of the younger leaves are still hanging on and look pretty healthy. Before the move, it was in really really good shape (3 flowers came out in the dead of winter) and was not experiencing any leaf loss beyond what one would expect naturally. I'm not planning on really doing anything with this guy besides giving it lost of humidity and sun, but let me know if there's anything I can do to make sure its condition doesn't worsen and it ends up on a path to recovery.

- The Eleanor Roosevelt has lost pretty much all of its leaves. There are still a few that are not totally dried out but I think they'll probably die off in the next few days. However, if I scratch the bark of the plant, there is still green flesh underneath which tells me the plant is not totally dead yet. Before the move, this one was in pretty good shape though a few leaves were turning yellow and falling off, probably just due to the fact that it's winter. Should I try trimming this one back (and if so how much?) or just let it chill and pray for the best?


A bit of background on the move itself:

- Seeing as it's been very cold in this part of the country recently, I boxed all of them up and kept them in the climate-controlled truck cabin for the entire ride. 
- My truck actually broke down midway through the drive and had no heat for about 2.5h, which briefly exposed all plants in the cabin to slightly-below-freezing temperatures (say 25-30 deg F) for about 1.5h.
- I stayed overnight in a hotel and brought all the plants inside with me. In so doing, they were exposed to well-below-freezing temperatures (10-15 deg F) for a minute or two.
- There were many other plants in the cabin with me: pilea, jade, red banana, oxalis, pregnant onion. These all seem to be adjusting very well with the exception of the banana plant, which is suffering a little bit but I think should be fine.

I am an overly-anxious plant parent. I have been doing this for about 6 months now and have kept my plants in relatively good condition! However, I always worry that I am doing things wrong when a leaf shows up slightly yellow or the tips browns slightly. I never know whether I should make it a real issue or leave it alone. Usually, it goes away and I feel better, but I just want to make sure that this is pretty normal and I am not completely torturing my plants by letting them work through it.

houseplants,SOS MLT is on its last branches!,"Hi everyone.

I‚Äôve posted here many times before, and thanks to all who took the time to comment on what they think the problem is.

Quick background: the Meyer Lemon Tree has been indoors since I live in Boston, and at first it was doing well in the nursery pot. It has a grow light and it even blossomed and started to show the beginnings of a little fruit. Then, leaves started falling and drying out, and I was concerned that it was either root rot or too dry, so I took it out and transferred it to a terracotta clay pot because I read these are the best to avoid root rot. 

She then still kept getting worse and now is completely leafless. I figured that maybe the soil at the time (Miracle Grow all purpose) was retaining too much water as some redditors suggested, so I changed the soil to cactus and succulent soil that also mentions is good for citrus trees. I fertilized it when it was in the Miracle Grow soil and this as was about 2.5 weeks before I changed to the cactus soil. I didn‚Äôt want her to get fertilizer burn as I read is a thing, so I left her alone. She receives 12 hrs of grow light a day, and just today I decided it‚Äôs time to re fertilize her with espoma since everything else I‚Äôve tried isn‚Äôt working. 

Please take a look at the video with the link provided. She‚Äôs a mess, but I‚Äôm also confused about the black/dark spots on the brown/dying branches. Any help/insight is greatly appreciated!! I just have to get her through the winter so I can put her outside.

After the initial repot, it wasn't shedding as fast and seemed to be doing well but now don't know what to do.  Googling didn't come up of anything useful since I don't know what to call it.  Google lens didn't help either.

Looking at it seems only one of the three in the pot is exhibiting this colouration.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience in shipping houseplants across the atlantic ocean..? My friend and I have been making plans on exchanging cuttings of our houseplants to send to each other but I think we have been a little naive up until now lol.

Basically the idea was that I send her some cuttings of plants that are considered more pricey in the US, but are common in the EU and she would do it the other way around.

My other plants in ceramic pots are more tropical and enjoy the moisture (M. adonsonii and calathea, plus a few others) but when I got my m. Deliciosa and pilea moon valley I opted to keep them in the nursery pots since there's lots and lots of drainage holes at the bottom and I'll be devastated if they got overwatered.

houseplants,Outdoor plants repotting gone wrong - please help!,"After i did repotting - the plants always end up wilting (leaf went soft, wet and too moist).

Basically i live in Australia which is currently in Summer, however the weather seems pretty bad lately, strong wind, cloudy and kinda just random. I use Terracota pot mostly and this potting mix [Osmocote Premium Potting Mix](https://www.lovethegarden.com/au-en/product/scotts-osmocote-premium-potting-mix-25l) mixed with perlite. I did water the plants before repotting, slowly untangle if possible otherwise i cut the bottom of root bound plants. Then, moved them onto a new pot - added the soil gently without packing too hard, i did lightly tap the pot to help it settle, after that i water them just a little bit in the middle right under the plants and leave the plants in sheltered place for a few days.

I checked them daily, the soil still a bit moist after 3 days so i refrain watering them, the plants still fine and healthy at this stages but then after that it all start wilting. 

What did i do wrong?

1. Since the plants was sheltered, is it not getting enough sunlight?
2. I notice there is white powder/crystal all over the potting mix, Could i it be bad batch of potting mix?
3. Should i not water at all after repotting?
4. Do i repot them at the wrong time? Summer? Most of plants i bought is kinda random anything that is flowering. They are all root bound though.

I assume I need to break up the soil, dump it out, set some sort of soil/rock foundation for the plant, etc, but any other tips like what to mix in with the soil, how much light, etc would be so helpful. Thank you to this amazing community.

To the mods, I looked for an 'ask houseplants' section and didn't see one, so if this should be posted elsewhere please let me know.",7

houseplants,Pest ID?,"Hi all! I've noticed in recent weeks it appears some sort of pest has been munching away on my plants. :( I gave them a really good shower the other day and bought yellow sticky traps. After the shower, I saw lots of small, slender, silvery insects crawling on the soil that didn't look like fungus gnats. I had presumed maybe thrips? I try to only water when the soil is dry and all pots have good drainage.

My next move is to try wiping down the leaves with a diluted soap solution and giving another shower. I'm wondering if there's a better way to care or eliminate the pest? A lot of scaring and holes have appeared on the leaves and I'm worried for them.

Thank you for any insight!

Coming into spring I'm start to get some direct sun in the mornings, (when it's not raining, typical Irish weather), but I don't know if this is too much for any of my plants

I have a philodendron micans, heart leaf philodendron, scindapsus pictus and a baby string of hearts currently living on a shelf in front of the window
Will any of these babies suffer from a couple of hours of morning sun? Usually it moves past within an hour, but I'm just thinking about summer and how much longer the sun will be on this window.
I can move some to another shelf about 5 feet back directly facing the window but I  don't know if that will be too dark!

I don't want to stress out the plant by repotting again, but feel like it's necessary. Can I move it to perlite or leca to help prevent further root rot and also promote further root growth? If so, how should I go about it?

Would normally leave it in its new pot and just not water, but worried it's just going to deteriorate and have struggled to find anymore of this plant.

I'm pretty sure my BOP is 6+ ft now lol.

The issue is that I live in the desert (zone 9a), and all of my windows are W facing. I have a mini greenhouse with grow lights in the only dark corner so pretty its basically all bright/bright indirect light. Humidity is of course super low, even with a humidifier. I've looked at countless YouTube videos and I'm so confused on what houseplants I can choose that would add that tropical vibe, but wouldn't completely die from low humidity and bright light. I'm not the best plant mom, but I've only managed to kill off a bunch of Euphorbia Ammak, a Phaleonopsis orchid and sweet potato vines.

Recently, I noticed some of the leaves drooping and softening, which is strange since normally they're tall and firm. Today I tried gently pulling one of unhealthy looking leaves out and to my horror, an entire clump came out very easily. I then went around the rest of the plant to see if the rest of it was fine... loads more leaves and clumps came out super easily, with just a gentle tug.

houseplants,[Pics] How I run my plant ICU shelf + progress of Philodendron Scandens coming back from dead,"Long story short: I ordered a heart Philodendron, it arrived via post during the worst of this years winter outbreak. It was in transit for a week in temperatures like -15 celsius. Needless to say it was dead: half of it yellow and dried out, the other half completely wilted and about to die too.    


I decided to chop it down into pieces and propagate what's left of it. All of the cuttings went onto my **plant ICU** which is a small shelf in my bedroom dedicated to saving hopeless cases. It has a nice delicate light in the morning and it's the first thing I see when I wake up. I spray it with water twice a day and check on it anytime I get up or go to bed.   


I divided the cuttings into four ""units"" and note on the progress once a week. Some patients can move the units if they improve (or degrade) not to affect other cuttings or not to be affected by other cuttings. I use filtered water only and I change it every 5 days max, I also add a microscopic amount of fertiliser. So [this](https://imgur.com/a/qA2DBNy) and [this](https://imgur.com/a/iK81Key) are progress pic one month later. Unfortunately no starting pic :(   


From the left in the pics the plant IC units are:

* left, back: cuttings with leaves that will definitely make it to be planted: healthy roots, healthy aerial roots (6/13 survived)

* right, front: cuttings pulled from under soil: high change of mould if something goes wrong - this one looks good though! (1/4 survived)
* right, back: patients in critical state: some roots are about to rot but the aerial roots are still growing. (5 still fighting, many died after being here)

In my room, sunlight hits by bouncing off a white wall towards my stuff something like this, the considered ""Bright indirect light""

[https://www.ourhouseplants.com/imgs-content/light-guide-drawing-large.jpg](https://www.ourhouseplants.com/imgs-content/light-guide-drawing-large.jpg)

So I was wondering:

The infrared/visible sunlight as far as I know, it can heat things up, in summer here we reach temperatures of 35 ¬∞C

Does this mean that the sunlight would make them catch that temperature (35¬∞C or above) if i open the windows 1 or 2 hours to ventilate?

The room temperature usually is 26/27¬∞C, should I be concerned that it's get quite hot? Someone experienced that the plants gets a lot of hot or something like that?

houseplants,Need help with care for an Orchid,"Hello all! Let me preface by saying I'm not really a gardener, and my indoor cats make it pretty difficult to have any wonderful plants inside the house, and I've only ever rented so far. I've had mostly failures with planting and gardening, but I do have a lovely hibiscus bush/tree that I planted in a large fabric pot outside, along with a planter of some lilies. I suck at growing herbs. BUT something strange and remarkable has happened.

About a year ago, I bought an orchid plant from Aldi (our grocery store). It was beautiful, it lived for a while, even got that orchid food spray for them too. Flowers shed, but I figured hey, the leaves are still green, let me keep it and see if it'll stay alive. I haven't re-potted or re-planted it because, well, it doesn't really go in a pot of dirt. It's still in the same pot with moss that it's been in since last year, and I've been awful with taking care of it, but I'd water it and spray it with food when I can think of it. It's on the window ledge by the sink, which is the only sunny window we have in the house that the cats can't easily get to and don't really bother going for.

So here's where my astonishment comes in.... IT'S GROWING BUDS!!! It's got some stems coming out, going a bit sideways, but they are growing buds!!! I can't believe I didn't kill this beautiful creature.

HOW DO I KEEP IT ALIVE?? Better yet, what should I do to help it thrive better? I'm sure the poor roots need some TLC.

Please help this novice!! TIA

I have washed all affected plants, and I wipe their leaves and petioles and stems every day to get anything new off, but I know that‚Äôs not enough. I have also isolated these plants and  I‚Äôm watching every other plant now too. 

I don‚Äôt know if it matters or not, but so far I‚Äôve only noticed them on 4 of my coriaceous Anthuriums, 1 thick-leaved Philo, and 2 thin-leaves Philos. Maybe they‚Äôre more prone to them? 

Any tips and info on these bastards and how to eradicate them would be AMAZING, I know they‚Äôre a pain in the ass to deal with once they‚Äôre established, but since it‚Äôs only the early stages and it‚Äôs just a couple little white larvae crawling around, I figured I might be able to prevent an outbreak of them if I act fast... I do not want to deal with these once they‚Äôre established...",2
houseplants,Why does my calathea hate me?,"I bought a calathea eternal flame 4 months ago. It's not even close to being my first plant, and I got some way more complicated plants growing happily for a long time. But this plant. It had gorgeous leaves, but they show all the dust so I have to clean them all the time. New leaves are definitely not as nice as the old ones. Cannot be sprayed with tap water, too much chalk. All the leaf tips are brown. Too much water, too little? No clue. some laves have little scars on them, as if they were folded and snapped or something. And 2 days ago, spider mites. Where did they come from? I checked all my other plants, nothing. Just this one. I literally rubbed every single leaf so I can spray it with Anti-mite thing. It took forever cause even though the plant looks so miserable it has 7 million leaves. What does my plant want?",6

houseplants,Please Help,"Hi all.  My mom died on Tuesday.  She was a huge houseplant person and frequented this subreddit.  She has left behind 85 houseplants.  

She left some instructions on how to take care of them, and I spent the last year after she got sick learning from her on how to properly care for them (ex watering African violets with room temp water from the bottom).  She also gave away a ton of plants over the past year.  She had probably over 200 plants when she first got sick.  She was the type of person to take a leaf that fell off a plant and put it in water to grow a new plant, so there are multiples of a lot of the plants.

Even though I know the basics, the sheer number of plants has me feeling overwhelmed.  She told me it's okay if some of them die, but I would like to keep as many of them alive as I can, obviously.  Does anyone have any good tips on how to keep track of watering schedules and such?  I will also be moving in the spring so any advice on how to move a buttload of plants across the country is also very welcome.  

She has a wide variety of plants, from succulents to African violets to spider plants and a bunch of plants I can't remember the names of.  

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me!",2

In Singapore, you can purchase Pothos N'Joy for as low as SGD$5-$10 , but I've seen some US website selling them for USD$59! Is the price hike only seen in online retailers or are plants equally expensive in physical stores in your country? I'm just curious !",7

My place hasn‚Äôt had power since Sunday night, and thanks to an electrical fire, we don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôll have power again. I have a small ikea greenhouse that we brought into the bedroom we were camping out in and I stuffed as many plants as I could into it. But I have a big BOP, monstera, rubber plant, blue cebu, etc that I couldn‚Äôt fit. 

I‚Äôve worked so hard to find and properly care for my plants. Do you guys think they might make it? We had to leave our place because my husband and pets simply could not spend a sixth night in the freeze but obviously couldn‚Äôt bring my plants. I covered the greenhouse in blankets and tried to put trash bags over the bigger plants before we left tho. 

I plan on giving everyone a nice warm drink of water once I can. But idk what else to do. My rubber plant‚Äôs leaves all look ready to drop, my monstera looks deflated, my bigger pothos look slightly shriveled. I couldn‚Äôt make myself check in the greenhouse because I didn‚Äôt want to see how my stromanthe fared. I know I‚Äôm losing a calathea and a dieffenbachia for sure and I want to cry thinking about it. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the long rant. I have left all my items behind because of immigration twice now and never got those items back, so I have a lot of trauma about losing everything again, nevermind something I have poured so much love into. I‚Äôm absolutely torn to pieces about my plants. 

Any advice I would greatly appreciate.",20

houseplants,Moral question,"I travel for work. I recently stopped into a greenhouse four hours from home during some free time. I took some photos, including prices, and posted those along with my general impressions to my local fb group. I like to let people know if a particular nursery is worth the trip. 

Keen eyed members noticed a plant in one of the pictures that is very hard to get at home and quite popular. I had not planned to go back and buy anything but replied that if I had time I might go back and buy some.

Next day enough people had replied that I'm optimistic about buying some, so I drove back on my lunch break and bought fifteen plants for about ten bucks a piece. I went directly to several friends in the group and sold them the plant basically for cost. The remaining plants I listed for twenty dollars and sold them all in short order to happy people.

For the most part people understand that the time, transportation, and listing are all value added and a plant that has been unfindable locally is available. However I'm getting a lot of shit from people accusing me of being a flipper. What say you?",2

&amp;#x200B;

*I am new to reddit, so feel free to correct me if there once was a post similar to mine*

I wanted to share our love for all plants.

I find that I am one with nature more so than I thought (my nieces call me organic) 

I have always gardened with my dad, he taught me so much about the type of soil, types of plants that are good for our health and what not. 

its been a couple of years where my princess cleopatra (my cat) died and that's when I didn't want anymore animals and I just focused on being a plant mom. 

share your stories, what you love about your plants, your routine?

&amp;#x200B;

do you buy seeds? ready grown plants? do you just use your own used up vegetables to grow more around the house?  

&amp;#x200B;

I have different types of plant that need different care. I love them, I talk to them. tell them good morning (sounds crazy but feels good) I am always looking for the best light for them, since I live in a apartment but they have come a long way and they are all healthy and striving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but keep reminding myself of how plants have done so much for us when it comes to everything we do, breathe, eat, medicine, much more...

We used to have a bunch of succulents but we have a cat who likes to nibble on plants and most of them are highly toxic so we're down to a single echeveria and a haworthia, both of which are cat safe. I like house plants, especially now that I spend most of the day inside with winter and school. Our problem is finding plants that can tolerate low light and that we don't have to try to keep our cat away from (like we could anyway. He's figured out how to get pretty much anywhere he wants). Any recommendations for low-light, cat safe, preferably relatively low-maintenance indoor plants?

TL;DR: need plants that can tolerate low light conditions and won't kill my cat/make him sick",5

I have discovered that it‚Äôs planted in a way that all of the soil runs straight out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. It‚Äôs in a very strange soil. Very gritty, looks like a lot of minerals. Pretty much like the sandy dirt from the beach near a creek. I need to repot this because so much soil came out in the one time I watered it the plant is down deep in the pot. What type of soil do these prefer? I have a few options on hand. Including bonsai soil (all rock/clay), coco coir, regular potting soil, and a houseplant blend that‚Äôs cactus soil, orchid mix, and coco coir blended together. Do they need to be slowly up potted or can I move up a size or two and have it spread to fill the space? It‚Äôs in a tiny 2 inch pot now. I have a 4 inch one available and also some 3 inch pots.",6

I have it hanging by a south facing window, but we really haven't had much sun because of the constant snowy days. 

Is it a fussy plant? Should I just get it under a plant light? The soft leaves aren't going to firm back up, right?

What kind of lamp shade to look for or avoid?  Really hoping to make my home look less like a grow house from 3 blocks over üòÜ

 I know it will vary a lot as far as how much light it's starting with and how much I need etc...  But some general guidelines would be super helpful

Lamp A: looking for one that will give off a significant amount of light for a leggy umbrella tree that I'm rescuing after a decade of minimal light and has really turned a corner since I put a grow light over it. Doesn't have to be super stylish, but I like it to look like it belongs..
 
Lamp B: Second one  I'd like to have a primarily pretty lamp that gives off a moderate amount   (A really beautiful classic library/office...just  need enough to keep some peace lilies and pothos growing ) it is the lower level of a split level home facing west so it gets very little light. It needs a lamp or two so I'm hoping that I can find some that will fill both needs rather than get some gooseneck ones that will really ruin the room.

Will a lampshade diffuse a bright grow light and give some plants scattered around the room the bit they would need?",5

However, for quite some time I managed to keep my Clusia Rosea alive, but recently it started develop black spots on the leaves, especially the new ones.

I‚Äôve had a monstera for about 1 month and ever since, I‚Äôve noticed a single fly every few days and it‚Äôs finally occurred to me that the new plant must have something to do with the issue. It‚Äôs in a plastic pot because a ceramic one would be too heavy which I know effects how quickly the soil dries out so I‚Äôm going to water less and hope it helps. The plant is otherwise thriving, she has given me two new leaves within the last few weeks.

I have lots of Hoyas, so I thought the care would be fairly similar. I also have one other Dischidia that‚Äôs mounted on cork with sphagnum moss. I soak it a few times a week.

This Dischidia imbricata is in fairly dense organic soil. It‚Äôs still in its nursery pot and is sitting in a cache pot right now. As far as I can tell, it has little to no roots? Like I can basically pick that stick up and not much comes with it. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should water the pot and the ‚Äúroots‚Äù? Should I soak the stick? I‚Äôm definitely going to transfer it into orchid bark or something.

Any help is appreciated because I feel in over my head!",17

houseplants,PSA: moisture meters are not always reliable!,"I bought the most common moisture meter I see on here a while back. I relied on it heavily. It seemed pretty accurate...in my old, miracle gro or Vigoro generic potting mix, straight from the bag.

Now, I use miracle gro cactus soil mixed with a lot of perlite and worm castings. My plants seem to like it, it drains well and it stays light and doesn‚Äôt pack down. I also moved last November when I made the soil change. Initially I was bad and watered with tap water. I‚Äôve come to observe this tap water may have a lot of salts and minerals in it.

I kept using my trusty meter. But I started to raise an eyebrow when it kept claiming some of my plants were ‚Äúwet‚Äù...mostly the bigger plants. I didn‚Äôt water my bigger stuff for OVER A MONTH because it kept jumping right up to ‚Äúwet‚Äù and like any houseplant owner, I was freaking out that I might get root rot! I did eventually start using my finger too, but I guess I was tricked by the reading on the meter to thinking it felt slightly moist. Also, since this soil mix is very loose, it‚Äôs not always super easy to tell if it‚Äôs MOIST moist or just holding a lil bit of water but not really moist.

Finally I googled. And moisture meters don‚Äôt actually read moisture like I thought. Perhaps I‚Äôm late to the game and you all know this already. But for those of you that don‚Äôt, this is a PSA meant to help you save some sad plants.

Here‚Äôs the link that taught me what I needed to know:

[moisture meter explained](https://www.ohiotropics.com/2020/01/03/soil-moisture-meters-indoor-plants/)

TL:DR Moisture meters don‚Äôt actually read moisture. Because of this, they can be completely wrong because of other factors like minerals/salts in your soil and water. Get used to using your finger.",7

houseplants,ELI5: How does ‚Äúdirect sun‚Äù ‚Äúindirect sun‚Äù ‚Äúpart shade‚Äù etc. translate when exclusively using grow lights?,"Explain this to me like I‚Äôm 5 years old, literally. I can‚Äôt find many answers, and even fewer answers that are easy to understand. I‚Äôm a simple human. Ok, well I‚Äôm smart enough. But the nitty gritty of artificial lights for plants is often way too complicated and I can‚Äôt really understand it.

So say you have no sunlight at all and are only using LED full spectrum grow lights. Would ‚Äúindirect sun‚Äù or ‚Äúpart shade‚Äù plants need to be protected the same from the LED lights as the sun? Or can the plants take the full light from grow lights? How long is best to leave LED grow lights on?

I‚Äôve had many grow lights of varying sizes and brightness over a wide variety of plants- from veggie plants and herbs, to cacti, to typical tropical houseplants. So far I haven‚Äôt had a problem, that I know of, exposing all plants to LED grow lights directly for 14-16 hours a day. I‚Äôve had the lights range from 4‚Äù away providing direct light and across a narrow hall, giving indirect light. But some of my plants are getting a bit moody and it‚Äôs time I figure this out so I can individualize plant care rather than just give them all similar care and hope for the best.

Please make this as simple as possible for me, I‚Äôm so frustrated reading articles that go too in depth, are way over my head, and don‚Äôt even give any answers.

If you don‚Äôt even know how it works but you use LED grow lights for houseplants, I‚Äôd love to hear what has worked for you.

Thank you!",16

houseplants,Repotting Plants,"Hi,

New plant mama here...What type of containers/pots do you use when you hang your plants with macrame holders? 

I keep reading that most plants require pots with drainage holes, but if they're hanging how do you avoid the water dripping on the floor? Do pots with flat trays/drainage tray at the bottom of them sit well in macrame holders? Do I need to buy a plastic container with drainage holes and then put that into another pot with no holes?

I have a spider plant I'm waiting to repot and I'm not sure what type of pot to get if I'm hanging it up. I've never repotted my other plants either and they all have a plastic container with holes that sit in a 2nd pot with no drainage holes. I think its time to repot them, but I don't know what type to get.

For reference- I have a spider plant, money tree, pilea glauca, a chrysanthemum, and two succulents.",2

InteriorDesign,Question on ceiling works,"How important is it to have a finished ceiling?

So I hired a design shop to work on my forever home. They are brothers - 1 architect and 1 interior designer.

My home has a bare ceiling. It only has a cement finish and a few led bulbs screwed in. the designers are pushing hard to have the ceiling worked on and add more/better lighting.

While I agree that I hired designers to make my house look good. The ceiling estimate is ~1/4 of my budget. Which shocked me... I was telling them to deprioritized this and prioritize the more important ones (for me) such as having a perimeter fence, cemented carport and backyard (which are just mud/earth at this time) and having a bed, dining table and chairs.

They are telling me the estimate they provided is the maximum estimate for ceiling work and actuals will be much lower. 

I don't really have much knowledge on this, they have been good to me so far and I trust them not to take me for a ride. So I want to ask if there might be something they know by experience that they are unable to explain to me on the need to have a finished ceiling that this sub might enlighten me with.",4

InteriorDesign,Agonizing over choosing color in OLD house reno,"For the past six years mom has been renovating a house built in early 1800s in Tenn. Three contractors later (first two fleeced her), she‚Äôs ready for paint and flooring, hallelujah! 

However OMG she is agonizing over the paint. For as long as I can remember she‚Äôs wanted F&amp;B Green Blue in her house, but now that the walls are primed and samples are up, she‚Äôs worried it‚Äôs going to be too dark. It does read much darker than the photos she‚Äôs pined over for years. She put up a lighter shade (Teresa‚Äôs Green) which looks more like the look she wants but the contractor has her agonizing over BOTH colors being too dark. She‚Äôs too scared to lose another contractor that she‚Äôs giving him too much space in her brain, plus she‚Äôs loving the white primed walls and is now contemplating Alabaster white everywhere. I think over time white will feel clinical and antiseptic, or worse, show all the dirt. 

She‚Äôs got 10+ ft ceilings and floor to ceiling windows and I think the house can handle the color. However for comparison the color I love in my house (several zones south and less altitude), SW Sea Salt, looks vibrant in my house and dull in hers. To boot we‚Äôre having to choose colors in the drab light of winter and they contractor is pressuring her to choose this weekend. She feels like she‚Äôll never get around to repainting (caring for her husband with dementia) so this decision feels bigger than it needs to be. 

Should I push her towards the color she‚Äôs always wanted or let her chicken out with white? She wants my input since she plans to leave me the house but I just want her to be happy. I‚Äôll post a photo in the comments since I can‚Äôt figure out how to add here. 

Thanks to anyone who can put us out of our angst!!",8

InteriorDesign,Choosing an interior designer for kitchen - advice?,"We are redoing our kitchen and are strongly considering working with an independent interior designer to do so. There are other options (general contractor, designers associated with kitchen showrooms), but I'm hoping working with someone independent will provide us with an unbiased design based on what we want rather than what includes the most cabinets or is easiest to build. It will also give me drawings that I can shop around with different vendors and contractors, which will ultimately save money. 

Also, I have been talking to different designers and would really appreciate some. There is one designer whose style I really like. She was referred to me by a good contractor, and I was very positive about our phone discussion. EXCEPT, she is not a certified designer. No NKBA, no NCIDQ, no interior design degree. Red flag?",8

Would it be worth it to invest in a masters in design? Do employers care that much or do they mostly look at portfolios? If I take some classes and have a solid portfolio, will hiring managers look at me or not so much without an entire degree behind it?

InteriorDesign,Blending styles,"I know this can be done tastefully but I wanted peoples thoughts because I can‚Äôt really find much about blending these two styles. They seem to have a lot in common but the differences are quite different. 

I am working on designing and decorating our home so I‚Äôve been researching design styles so I‚Äôm happy with the outcome and design intentionally. I love textures, mandalas, Buddhism and culture, wood, baskets and colors so I was really drawn to Boho. There are some things about boho that I‚Äôm not into such as super bright colors, tons of macrame, fabric strips hanging from walls and rugs. I can‚Äôt do rugs because I have kids and they‚Äôre going to make them dirty all the time lol. I prefer a clean wood floor. I‚Äôm also kind of a minimalist so boho can be a bit busy for me. 

So then I stumbled upon Japandi and it also really speaks to me. I really love the minimalism and zen atmosphere but also the cozy textures of it. I also much prefer muted earthy tones like sage, moss, mustard, etc to bright pinks, reds. Is there a way to tastefully blend elements of both I like? I thought it would be fun to have a discussion.

I am looking to get a mirror wall put up in my home yoga/dance studio. This room has lots of natural sunlight when the sun sets in the evening. The sun isn't directly facing the room, but the sunlight that comes in is very bright.

I'm seeking advice from the home improvement Reddit community on whether or not the sunlight will be a big issue with a mirror wall? The mirror wall would be very difficult to take down, so if we commit we can't go back. Generally, I'm looking for any advice from people who have large mirrors that receive lots of sunlight in their own homes/offices/spaces, and if this causes overheating/any other issues that I should weigh the pros and cons of before deciding.

She will be online and actively answering questions for about an hour.

Please see below for a statement from her:

----

Have questions about the NCIDQ Exam?  Wondering if you qualify?  Curious about attending a CIDA accredited program vs. non-CIDA accredited program?  Are you aware of the various interior design regulations in place across North America?  Do you know the definition of interior design?  Learn from CIDQ staff member, Kimberly, as she answers these questions and more during an upcoming AMA.

----

If you'll be busy at that time but still want to ask a question, or questions, go ahead and make a comment in this thread and I will copy the questions over to the AMA thread when it's posted. I'll also be working with her to get the thread posted up in the morning so questions have time to accumulate on the day of the AMA.

these layouts both use two 10ft precut slabs of countertop

she mentioned having family over for holidays and wanting seating for 6, they like to sit at the table and play board games.

i'm working on the kitchen now and would love to get your opinions/comparisons/feedback on these two options.      more specifically on the functionality of floor plans rather than decor (which is not added/complete)

for people who dont generally read blueprints or construction documents (my client has a really hard time with them) it would be great to know if any thing i provided really helped to make sense of the space.

I have also been looking at the different CIDQ paths and saw that there is an ‚Äòalternative review program.‚Äô Has anyone taken this unconventional path?

I was looking into the Interior Design Institute for some education. Though it is not a CIDA accredited program, could my marketing degree and this diploma course make me eligible to take the NCIDQ after gaining the minimum amount of work experience hours?",8
InteriorDesign,Large Gas Fireplace Insert; Is my only option removal?,"[Album for reference](https://imgur.com/a/2nKJVXS)

Last two photos are the large sofa in a different orientation trying to work with what we got.

Hello! I am trying to work around a very large gas fireplace insert. Previous owner of the home installed it, and it wasn't a deal breaker for me when we bought the house. However over the course of a few months I have grown to despise it. I don't want the TV over the fireplace because it's far too high, and because there is a large amount of heat being generated when the fireplace is in use which might damage the TV.

Ideally, this space is used to entertain and consume media, so Conversation and TV are at the forefront of what we want to do in this space. With a fireplace this large, it feels like its taking over.

The sofas we have are only temporary, and will be replaced soon. While doing the furniture upgrades and adding shelving etc this spring I want to know if there is a way to live with this beast of an insert, as the girlfriend isn't sold on removal as the units surrounding us still have their original fireplaces from 2009. (We are a center unit).

Any and all help is appreciated. I am open to a lot of ideas.",9
InteriorDesign,Hello everyone! Love this sub + Q about color on color furniture/floor,"So, I have never given thought to interior design nor even decor really up until about a week ago when a great place came up for rent in an area that's highly desirable and lacking in general availability.  After a long hunt, it all worked out.  We've all been there, or most of us, I'm sure.

Anyway, I have found something truly amazing in looking into furnishing a house... art appreciation!  Jean Dunand's work is the first stuff to ""speak"" to me and I now know what it means for someone to be caught by an artwork and have to have it.  However, his works are up there in the echelons of intangible budgets for me currently.  The styling, execution, and materials used, however, was a great starting place and I have since found a pocket in which to look for things in my price range.

To the question:  The floors of concern to me are rouge, like a red clay cement (we're in the desert, here) but still definitely a shade of red and not oak-y or reddish brown.  I can post a picture if need be.  What color furniture would go well with this all in concert?  I have been thinking dark green, very little amounts of gold accents, and medium-shaded grey for the chair/couch stuff, and then... I'm stumped!  Would black throw us off?  Would white be jarring?  Would a dark wood-flavored mix blend too much into the floor and feel off?  I'm thinking about the colors in relation to the floor and also ensemble in relation to each other in regards to coffee tables, end tables, chairs, couches, TV stands/book cases, and what not.

Maybe I am overthinking it all, but regardless, I really love this scene and I would appreciate any advice because as I said, I know nooothing Lebowski.

EDIT: TO ADD PHOTOS.

The floor is a little more rouge in person.  I put in that cabinet thing today, it can go anywhere really, but this gives you an idea of what I'm working with.

InteriorDesign,A bit lost... where do I even start?,"I recently moved into a new house, and have basically no furniture at all. Mattress on the floor, no couch, no chairs, no rugs, etc. I‚Äôve spent weeks looking through various furniture and photos of example rooms, and I don‚Äôt like any of it... none of it feels like ‚Äúme‚Äù, and I can‚Äôt picture how a particular piece of furniture would actually look, or how it would fit in with the rest of the house as I get more furniture. Even something like buying a plain colored rug... I have no idea what it would actually look like once everything else was in. I have hundreds of examples of stuff I don‚Äôt like and why, but I have no idea what I *do like*.

I think the right answer is to hire an interior designer, but here‚Äôs the problem: I probably sound like the most annoying kind of client ever, right? I have no idea how to answer the questions about what style I‚Äôm looking for/etc. Not sure how I want the rooms layed out, not sure what colors I like for furniture, etc. Is there anything I should look for in an interior designer who may be able to help someone like me?

InteriorDesign,Help! Advice for a ID student who's had a ROUGH start.,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM
...
If you think some backstory would make a difference, I appreciate any time taken to understand where I'm coming from further. It's been a rough journey and I'm really looking for any great advice to a route of less time wasted!

A few years ago, I moved so I could go to what you could call a career college for woodworking. I wanted to get into furniture design. It was meant to be a 9 month intensive program of full time work as one of a few apprentices. Long story short, the teacher was a grouchy old man who was ready to retire and sell the building. Many times he'd leave to run some errands and not come back for several hours. He was old fashioned and clearly sexist, this was agreed on by the other apprentices and the other man who contributed to renting the building and light teaching so he could do his work there. Our teacher ended up selling all the equipment and machines months prior to any of us finishing our apprenticeships when he thought he found someone to buy the building. They didn't, and he expected us all to finish and continue paying without the equipment or even him about half the time. In the end, I left 2 months prior to finishing and I'm shocked anyone would think 9 months was long enough to understand the basics for furniture making. At least not by the way taught. He ended up moving out of the state and leaving the building to his buddy because he couldn't wait to retire any longer.

After leaving, I was still clueless how I was supposed to move up in furniture design. At this point I was still under the impression I would ever be able to afford a degree. There was a point where I was supposed to assist a couple who did custom furniture orders, they liked the little work I had done and said they wanted to hire me so I could learn along assisting them with furniture, with some secretary and storefront work. We met several times over a few months, but they were still unsure how much they'd be able to pay me. I gave in, stopped asking and stopped meeting with them. As much as I'd love to do it solely for the experience, they did insist they could pay and there's no way I could have pro bono.

With that being a dead end, I was hired as a Design Consultant for a custom furniture store. This is basically sales and customizing furniture orders for the sake of interior decorating. I'd never done sales and dreaded it, I was unfortunately great at it and have been doing it for two years. It didn't take me long to decide though that I'd rather be in control of the big picture, Interior Design over Furniture Design. After looking into what it'd take to get a license in interior design, I decided I'd bite the bullet and say fine, Im will willing put myself into large amounts of debt for a degree in interior architecture and design. I mean I worked with a group of ladies who were all 50+ and loved arguing with a 20 something year old about splitting sales they felt they deserved because they had helped my clients for 10 minutes on my day off. I would've gotten out sooner if I knew that this would not count as experience in the interior design world. Great.

So for the past year to year and a half, I started taking a class or two at a time just online from the local CC. The goal was to take as many classes that I could use to transfer credits and avoid being put in further debt from schools whose classes are $1,000+ each. I'd spoken to the Academy of Art University in SF because theres is the only option with an accredited and online degree. An admissions Counselor told me any of the ID classes that were 300 and up would be transferrable, so that's what I've been taking while also working full time. Last year I started to seriously consider quitting my job so I could achieve my degree faster, but I just didn't know how I could afford it. I also didn't want to put that kind of stress on my bf (now fianc√©), not to mention I felt bad quitting our small team of designers in the middle of the pandemic. I finally left after our managers/owners (family owned) made it unbearable to continue working for them (repeatedly leaving on vacation and paying us late in the middle of a pandemic among other things). They even made fun of us for complaining when they got back. A ballsy move for a place that didn't offer benefits.

After finally leaving so I could go to school full time, I wanted to create a laid out timeline so I'd know what to take, how long, etc. So last week, I spoke to the liaison counselor for ID from the CC I'm taking classes from. She also didn't have the transfer guide for the Academy, but found that none of the classes I'd been taking were transferable to them. NONE. I understand the private schools' counselors work off commission and sales, but I didn't think they'd go as far as lying about what's transferable so that they could waste my time with the hope of making as much as possible off of me. There's no way this would work in the way they thought. I'll be surprised if any advice leads me to still attend a private school.

My counselor at the CC gave me a nice script for confronting the Academy counselors, but unfortunately this wouldn't lead anywhere since I think it'd be a waste of my time to go with them. She also recommended I email my ID teacher who has an extensive background in the industry. I have, but I'm still waiting for a response and am not sure if she'll like to spend much time giving free counsel. I find I'm basically starting over, again. The Academy felt like a route to less time wasted but now I'm feeling at a loss of a plan, and questioning the legitimacy of the advice I've received and work I've been doing. I'm also just feeling quite bad for my fianc√© who's stuck by me and followed me in the first place to move so I'd be able to go to the furniture school. He's 9 years older than I am, and not that he has ever put pressure on me about our timeline but it's something I can't help but consider for the sake of a family. He's very supportive about continuing, but of course I still have to feel bad that this may mean we move again for the sake of my school that hasn't done anything for us yet.

I am still determined to get my degree but am at a loss of a plan. I'm trying to decide if an ID accredited college would be beneficial to my timeline and advancing or if this would lead to unnecessary stress and money spent. If we weren't to move, this would mean SAC State, and after talking we don't intend on staying in the area anyway.

TL;DR

Have you noticed a difference in career advancement for those who went to an accredited ID college vs those who haven't? / Would you take that into consideration when hiring graduates?

Anything recommended to consider when looking at ID schools.",11

So as a compromise we are painting an accent wall in Inchrya Blue with the remaining three walls a lighter colour. 

I‚Äôve read that the main focal point of a bedroom is the bed, therefore this is where an accent wall should go. 

However the bedroom has a pretty elaborate fireplace, and the bed itself is pretty minimal.

So my question is, will an accent wall colour against a fireplace work or should I stick to keeping it by the bed?",16

I‚Äôm getting ready to relocate to a new city, and I am currently in school to get a bachelor‚Äôs in ID. All of my schooling is online, so I have a lot of freedom when it comes to working. Ultimately, I want to pursue commercial/restaurant design, but I‚Äôm only in my first semester of school so I still have a lot to learn.

For a little more than a year now, I‚Äôve been working as a Kitchen &amp; Bath designer at a big box retail store, which has been mostly great because I have learned a ton and have designed some projects that I‚Äôm really proud of! The issue, however, is that it is a retail job at the end of the day, and working for a big retail company means I have to deal with a lot of retail related issues, which can be very draining. I‚Äôve worked retail for a total of 8 years, and I‚Äôm just kinda burnt out with it.

I wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions of jobs I could possibly work that would be related to the design field that aren‚Äôt necessarily a retail job. I‚Äôve thought about looking at places like local counter shops to see about working in the showroom, which would still be customer service but not necessarily ‚Äúretail‚Äù. I‚Äôve also thought about reaching out to firms in the city I‚Äôll be moving to and checking maybe to be an office assistant? I don‚Äôt know any CAD or modeling software yet, so I think I‚Äôm still unqualified for an internship or any junior design work. I‚Äôm not sure if design firms hire inexperienced assistants, and COVID just makes it harder to find a job.

1. Made an open kitchen, semi-open bathroom (dry and wet partition), moved the dining table to the living room position, making the space when you enter the door suddenly become spacious. And because the fantasy place runs through the kitchen and bathroom dry area, we used the same type of bricks, hexagonal tiles, for the three parts of the floor.

My girlfriend studies interior design and is looking for people to complete a survey based on home renovation; particularly in British Georgian or grade 2 listed buildings. This is to help with her research on a current project with a live client. If you are able to spare 5 minutes to complete the survey this would be a great help! If you have any experience staying in or renovating Georgian or grade 2 listed buildings this would be an added bonus. Thank you!

[Take the 5 minute survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BXW6YXZ?fbclid=IwAR10KYmKDPmNifPmP71f8xxreaFjkG8vz6iaeKwTuYaY7G91iPTfASqZprY)",3

InteriorDesign,I need help with choosing stair tread finish from someone who knows what they're doing lol,"I'm in the process of prepping my stairs to go from carpet to hardwood. I've already prepped my bottom stairs and will do the upper stair case afterwards. Although I'd be able to get a perfect match if I stain it myself, I'll be using stair-tread.com's pre-finished ""retro treads"" because I don't want to mess with sanding, patching, staining, and sealing.
I'd like to match them to the original flooring (engineered vinyl plank) as best as possible, but the samples they sent me are just slightly more red than my golden floor, but really only noticeable in certain lighting. Will the slight variation in color actually draw more attention to the fact that they're slight off? Or am I over thinking it?


I took several photos in various lighting. The risers will be white to match the trim. https://imgur.com/a/GzaXnbe


Also, my floor is EVP, and these retro-treads are hardwood. Will that be weird?",16

We were hoping to put an island somewhere instead of the two sided kitchen, but it just won't work given the width. We thought about a peninsula but figured that would break up the space too much and create too tight of a path into the kitchen from dining. We're doing open shelving towards the dining room, and the cabinet to the right of the fridge will be pantry.


I'm wondering if we should take the cabinets above the microwave/fridge all the way to the ceiling? Maybe have open boxes at the top. Above the sink, I'm not sure if we should do a raised cabinet, open shelving, or leave it bare. We had thought about not doing uppers on the sink side as well, but think we need the storage space.


What do you think? We'd love to get some opinions or ideas.",10

InteriorDesign,Student Trying to Learn about Spec'ing Furniture,"Hi fellow designers. I'm an ID student and something I struggle with is finding furniture that fits my needs. Sometimes it's easy, and a lot of the time in class we look for things based on an overall design style, and not super specific needs. However, when it comes to things like ""I need this material, this colour, these features"" I struggle to know where to look, and I'm wondering how to get better at this?

I usually start by googling a general description of a product I want, and then looking through the links for anything that could lead me to a suitable product. This works a lot for simple things like flooring, wallpapers, lighting, etc. but it gets messy with furniture.

An example: I've been looking for a good adjustable shelving unit for myself for literally months, on and off, and I'm almost at the point where I'm just going to call a cabinet maker in my city to do a bespoke unit. It's not even complex, I basically want a Billy bookshelf from Ikea but with solid flat panel doors and hinges on the inside. I swear I cannot find that ANYWHERE in Canada. If I can't find something that is such a simple design, I feel like I'm going to struggle a lot when I'm working professionally. 

Do any of you have tips on how to improve my search to better find the things I need, when I need to spec something more specific than just ""blue upholstery, art deco style couch""? This is challenging.",7

InteriorDesign,New Home Office Advice Appreciated,"Hello everyone, new to this sub but seeing some of the posts here I def think I could use some advice. I move into a new place next week and looking to make a nice home office. I have a 14' by 8'6'' den that I can use for myself. The weird thing about the den though is that there is no door and one of the longer walls is open right into our main hallway.

I am a big techy. So hoping to get a (standing) desk, chair, and monitors for sure. I would love to get a couch, coffee table, and tv as well since I like to switch it up from my desk. I think I have ceiling-mounted lights but might need a floor lamp and some type of small table would be cool for some junk and break up the one-directional look of the room..

&amp;#x200B;

My thought right now is the attached picture. TV would be on the right wall. I was going to paint the top wall with some whiteboard paint. Random pics around the swatch of whiteboard paint and on the left wall. And for the bottom wall that isn't a real wall, I was thinking of building a see-thru bookshelf. The shoe closet is in the top left so we would lose access to that, so was thinking the bookshelf would be nice to keep light coming in from different angles, put some shrubs, use some of the pockets for  shoes, and some for random trinkets.

Also, when putting in an island, is it more convenient to have a sink on the island, on the actual counter, or both?

I'm an interior design student and I'm looking for advice on what kinds of tech you all use in design? I have a great PC for ACAD, Revit, and SketchUp Pro, and we've done a decent amount of hand drawing (technical and rendering), but I'm looking to find something new to draw digitally with. I love markers and ink, or even watercolour, but digital just seems to much easier to manage than a bunch of other tools. I've been looking at iPads and Wacom tablets, but honestly is it worth it? Will it be useful or is that a waste of my money? 

I don't want to buy something that is so expensive if it won't actually be helpful to me as a future designer.",3

InteriorDesign,Potential new design business - Feedback needed!,"Hey all! 

Hope you‚Äôre having a good week so far. 

I‚Äôve had what I think is a cool idea for a business within the interior design space and would love your feedback and constructive criticism. I‚Äôm only 24 so be nice! :D 

The idea I have is essentially an online service in the form of the website, which you would visit when you were starting an interior design project. 

You‚Äôd enter the website and insert some key words such a ‚Äògrey‚Äô ‚Äòsofa‚Äô ‚Äòcushion‚Äô and once you pressed search, it would return with a catalogue of items that matched that description. It would list each item and have a link to the place where you can buy it from. 
In the future I would ensure you‚Äôd be able to buy it through the website so it would be an all in one service. 

The service would work where you‚Äôd get 5 free searches but then additional would cost per search, only a small amount or additionally if there were interior designers who would use it, they could pay a monthly fee for unlimited searches. 

I‚Äôm not sure if anything like this exists already but I‚Äôm keen to hear your feedback or maybe even some improvements you think could be added! 

All the best!

I can't decide how noticeable this is. Most coffee tables I've seen are no taller than the seat of the couch height. However with other decorations, like throw pillows, a plant on the coffee table, some other books, and a side table, its not the most noticeable. Just wondering if this is a hard and fast rule that I'm breaking. The futon is very low and I do have another coffee table that is low enough but it is not as good a style as the taller one.",13

InteriorDesign,Renovating flat - help/ideas with the plan?,"[Proposed plan](https://preview.redd.it/xgdhl1ridgz51.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=211696ea34fab95eebe27c45d9594a6e8db77011)

I'm renovating a small 22sqr metre flat. It's a difficult space with some crazy angled walls. The more accurate plan with measurements is how I'm considered doing it. The other image without any measurements is less accurate but how the flat is currently laid out. I've got tunnel-vision on how I've made my plan and any suggestion for changing things up would help!

Some factors to know:

1. From the current layout plan, the bathroom walls are the only ones that can't get knocked down. The bathroom is the small square in the middle, in front of the main door.
2. On my projected plan, I've spearated the bathroom into three rough sections to fit the sink/toilet/shower but without having put explicit measurements for the toilet and sink.
3. There is only one window in the flat.

While, I quite like my plan, I'm having trouble with the bathroom. It's a pretty narrow path to get to the shower. I've had a few ideas of how to handle it:

1. Put the toilet where I've labeled sink and build the tank into the wall. I don't like the idea of entering the bathroom straight to the toilet, especially given the kitchen is on the other side.
2. Have a wall-mounted tank high up. I haven't finished doing the research to see how much space this will save.
3. Possibly I can build the tank into the wall that I've said can't be knocked over, there might be some lee-way.

I haven't thought of the bedroom in any detail. I was trying to avoid putting the Murphy bed/desk against the left-hand wall as it feels strange and unaesthetic in relation to the main entrance door. Also, having your head against the wall where there's the building's hallway is maybe not ideal. I'm open to all suggestions here, really!

Thanks a lot!

InteriorDesign,"2020 Comparisons: RH (+Modern) vs. DWR vs. C&amp;B (+CB2) vs. R&amp;B vs. Others (Ethan Allen, William Sonoma, etc.)?","Looking to re-furnish a 1-bedroom city apartment at a medium-high quality/price range.

Currently have all DWR pieces but hoping to 'shift' from mid-century modern (read: Noguchi table, Tolomeo shade lamp, Zenith shag rug, white 86"" Bantam sofa and armchair w/ exposed walnut legs) to something 'older' and more luxurious (perhaps more brass, heavier and darker pieces).

Quality is a top priority (I read that West Elm is pricy but materials/build quality is low), and prefer these 'nationwide' brands vs. boutiques.

Does anyone have an idea on the current state of these retailers, specifically with regard to quality?

so I have hit a bit of a road block in this building i am currently working on, i received as built core and shell and jt was not properly coordinated for any other discipline at all, that lead the MEP guy pass HVAC (mini and multisplit ducts) and water and so (terrible i know)

so my question is the following, is there a cad or image of a typical detail of an operable gypsum board ceiling to be able to maintain the MEP ducts? residential not offices keeping style, spot lights, cove lights.. etc so sort of a chain fixing or what have you? 

been rummaging through my library and knauf‚Äôs but nothing. 

Thanks alot",4
